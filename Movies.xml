Istotne jest jak najszybsze postawienie diagnozy i wdrożenie właściwej terapii. Rodzice Mai są tego świadomi, ponieważ ich starsza córka Wiktoria również cierpi na niedosłuch. Najlepszym możliwym rozwiązaniem poprawiającym efektywność słuchu okazało się wszczepienie implantu ślimakowego. Nadchodzi długo wyczekiwany termin zabiegu. Cała rodzina zjawia się w szpitalu. W trakcie operacji Mai lekarz stwierdza, że jest to ekstremalnie trudny przypadek. Widzowie zobaczą, czy zabieg zakończy się sukcesem(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Jane nie rozumie, dlaczego siostra Owena, Olivia jest do niej tak wrogo nastawiona. Prawniczka prosi Kim, by reprezentowała kobietę podczas rozprawy rozwodowej. Mąż Olivii, Bryan porzucił ją, gdy stał się bardzo bogaty. Przed ślubem podpisali intercyzę, więc po oficjalnym rozstaniu siostra Owena może liczyć jedynie na ułamek majątku. Olivia wyznaje, że właściwie nie chce rozwodu, ale czuje się głęboko zraniona, bo Bryan zdradza ją z komputerową aplikacją o wyglądzie blond piękności. Kim musi udowodnić w sądzie, że mężczyzna żyje w wirtualnej rzeczywistości. Z kolei klientką Jane zostaje Rita Curtis, była pracownica supermarketu, która uważa, że została bezpodstawnie zwolniona. Prawniczka czuje, że łączy ją z tą kobietą znacznie więcej, niż mogłoby się wydawać na pierwszy rzut oka. Tymczasem Grayston pracuje nad umową spółki Stacy i Nikki. Odkrywa, że LePree nie jest osobą, za którą się podaje. Jane nie chce, by jej przyjaciółka powierzyła oszustce oszczędności swojego życia(n)</desc>

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Mąż Olivii, Bryan porzucił ją, gdy stał się bardzo bogaty. Przed ślubem podpisali intercyzę, więc po oficjalnym rozstaniu siostra Owena może liczyć jedynie na ułamek majątku.

    <sub-title lang="en">Spelling Bee.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's excited to learn that the Annual Spelling Bee final will be between Cackle's and Pentangle's. All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>

Roy can't believe it ­ he loves all of his toys and doesn't want to give any to Mrs Barker's Charity Shop, The Old Bag. Roy isn't the only family member having trouble parting with their old, unused items. Bill becomes incredibly attached to some old tight fitting clothes, and there's a scarf Maura has her eye on too. Mr Barker is just as reluctant as Roy, and when Mrs Barker is about to catch them both hiding out in Reg's shed, Roy wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy loses his brand new cape in a villainous encounter with The Messer and Glitterella. He had given Finn his old cape ­ much to Finn's delight, and is reluctant to take it back, but Finn reassures him that who we are is much more important than the things we own. Back in reality, Roy remembers this, and teaches Mr Barker how good it feels to pass things on!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's just another day at the Furchester Hotel, that is until the Furball, a bouncing furry monster ball, arrives in a flurry of bouncing and chanting! Soon all the Furchesters are jumping and chanting 'Furball!' too. Elmo asks why they are all shouting 'Furball' and Furgus says that it's because the Furball has arrived, it's the best game ever, whenever he turns up at the hotel they all play a game of 'Furball', he's very excited and goes to get his Furball equipment bag and everything is there except his Furball shoes. Furgus and Funella go to look for his shoes and tell Phoebe and Elmo to keep an eye on the Furball and not let him out of their sight. Just at that moment, the Furball disappears, only for them to spot him up on the balcony, they're soon chasing him all over the hotel. Phoebe decides to look in her Dad's Furball bag and finds a Furball net, they hear boinging and get ready to pounce, but they catch a very suspicious looking rabbit instead. Cookie Monster then comes along and tells them to use Furball bait - a cookie! They put the cookie in the Furball net and wait, but instead of catching a Furball they catch Cookie Monster instead, with which he remembers that cookies are Cookie Monster bait, not Furball bait(n)</desc>
