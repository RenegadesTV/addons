    <title lang="en">Whitney. "Can I Be Me"</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.(c)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Little Divas: Tantrums &amp; Tiaras</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Light-hearted documentary shedding light on the lives of people whose extravagant tastes often leave their parents or significant others substantially out of pocket. These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiance as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Pełne odważnego humoru perypetie czterech ośmiolatków z klasy II b. Najmądrzejszy z całej paczki Konieczko jest zdeklarowanym ateistą. Dzięki swojej inteligencji zamierza przejąć kiedyś władzę nad światem. Póki co wiedza przeszkadza mu w codziennej komunikacji z otoczeniem. Anusiak odznacza się największym brakiem kultury i jest najsilniejszy wśród kolegów. Jest synem chłopa i planuje kiedyś założyć związek zawodowy. Najbogatszy i najsprytniejszy Maślana to kapitalista, który jest przekonany, że wszystko można kupić. Zombie Czesio, w którym za życia skumulowały się liczne wady rozwojowe i genetyczne, marzy o tym, by zostać piosenkarzem. W przeciwieństwie do swoich kumpli jest miły i życzliwy. Cała czwórka nieustannie naraża się swojej nauczycielce, surowej pani Frał. Niesforne łobuzy często też dokuczają koleżance z klasy, Andżelice, która przeprowadziła się z rodzicami do Polski ze Stanów. Odważna i wygadana dziewczynka w przyszłości planuje bogato wyjść za mąż.</desc>
