    <desc lang="en">Knockout week comes to a close as the 10 remaining cooks are split into two teams of five. Their challenge is to create a three-course meal in relay, with no communication allowed. They have 20 minutes each, in which time they all have to plan, create and cook a starter featuring scallops, a main course with chicken and a dessert celebrating brown sugar. The winners will automatically become semi-finalists, while the other five have to fight it out again next week to earn their place. Presented by John Torode and Gregg Wallace.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Part two of two. The horticultural enthusiast explores Japan during autumn. He begins as he did in the spring, at one of the `three great gardens of Japan' to learn how they are protected from the coming winter. Monty follows the history of the Japanese garden through the military strongholds of past leaders to the many styles, new and old, of the iconic stroll garden and finds a slice of Victorian England in the heart of Tokyo. He also learns how the Japanese are weaving nature into their concrete urban jungle. He ends his journey by the Sea of Japan at a place that makes art out of its gardens.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Datshiane Navanayagam reveals the shocking conditions that tenants of one of Britain's biggest social landlords are being forced to live in. A year-long investigation finds that Sanctuary Housing left family homes in disrepair and uncovers evidence that this had a critical impact on the health of some of their most vulnerable tenants. As the housing association has grown, official channels of complaint have failed to force it to act reasonably, leaving residents feeling voiceless.

    <desc lang="en">Catherine and Simon went through years of fertility treatment to have their first son, which took a toll on their love life, but five years later, awaiting an elective C-section for their second baby, it's a different story - a spontaneous romantic evening resulted in an unexpected positive pregnancy test. Heather ran into complications during her first pregnancy and had to deliver twins at 24 weeks. They pulled through, but cerebral palsy and other issues have meant she is now a full-time carer to them both. She also has Alfie, and after he was born, she and partner Dan decided they would have a fourth child to give him a companion to help share the responsibility of siblings with a disability. Christian couple Naomi and Dan tied the knot young and had their first child 13 months ago. Now, they're back at Southmead for baby number two.(n)</desc>

The Terminator star famously insisted on performing many of his own stunts during his Hollywood action-man heyday, and here, he highlights the achievements of fellow stars whose efforts produced thrilling set-pieces on-screen. However, Arnie does not limit himself to high-octane antics from the silver screen. He also showcases stand-alone feats, such as Jean Claude Van Damme's daring splits manoeuvre between two moving trucks, and Felix Baumgartner's free fall to Earth from the stratosphere. Includes commentary from fans, comedians, stunt coordinators and the daredevils themselves.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson and James May pay tribute to Saab, the Swedish car manufacturer that created several successful models since the late 1940s, but has now ceased production. Richard Hammond takes the passenger's seat in a Skoda rally car that races a rocket-propelled flying man, and actor Matt Smith gets behind the wheel of the Reasonably Priced Car. Jeremy also shreds the tyres of the noisy Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale and the 510bhp Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG Black Series.(n)</desc>

With the help of out-takes, studio conversations between the band and never-heard-before outside of Abbey Road, Howard gets `under the bonnet' of the album, taking the music apart and reassembling it to reveal how it works. Producer George Martin and his team constructed the album sound by sound, layer by layer - a formula that became the norm for just about every rock act who followed. (BBC Four/radiotimes.com)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The wildlife of Africa's green belt, an area spanning 5,500km from Uganda in the east to Sierra Leone in the west, which is hotter, brighter and wetter than anywhere else on the continent, allowing plants to flourish. People and animals have learned to exploit this abundance - colobus monkeys have developed specialised bacteria-filled stomachs to neutralise the toxins found in their leafy diet, while the Bakaya and Fang tribes use plant poisons to stun their quarry when hunting.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">McGee deals with his father's recent death by writing him a letter outlining the details of his latest investigation. The case involved tracking down a hactivist collective known as Krampus, who were thought to have been responsible for an incident in which the internet crashed all over Washington, DC. McGee and Abby brought in three known cyber-terrorists for questioning, and discover evidence that links the trio to an attempted breach of the Congress e-mail server and archive. However, when this line of inquiry reaches a dead-end, the team picks up a new lead that suggests an isolated hacker from Wisconsin may be responsible. This `lone wolf' scenario does not seem plausible to McGee, though, as he recalls a lesson his late father taught him. Crime drama, starring Sean Murray.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Light-hearted documentary shedding light on the lives of people whose extravagant tastes often leave their parents or significant others substantially out of pocket. These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiancé as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Alien Code</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Giorgio Tsoukalos contemplates whether aliens that once visited Earth deliberately left a series of clues that mankind was eventually meant to decipher. Many ancient sites, and even recent ones like Roswell, all seem to be associated with reports of something coming down from the sky. Tsoukalos' research demonstrates that many of these places share a common symbol or shape-concentric circles. What is the significance of these designs, and is it possible they contain a coded message left by alien visitors?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When Andy mistakenly eats a bowl of exotic fruit salad that Mr Hammond had left for the black-crested macaques back at Safari World, it’s up to Andy to put things right. Heading off in his safari-mobile, Andy jets off to Sulawesi in south-east Asia in search of some more fruit. To help him with his quest, he joins a troop of black-crested macaques, undoubtedly the best fruit finders in the forest! Will Andy make it back in time before Mr Hammond notices the missing fruit?</desc>

Things seem to be running perfectly when suddenly Dolly the Popstar’s music machine goes pop! Josiah the Business Man quickly calls Odd Job Laila, but Laila has bad news: the machine has run out of power. Amelia the Scientist comes up with a brilliant plan for turning star jumps into power for the machine, but it takes too much energy. Finally, just when it seems that the festival may have to be cancelled, the residents of Biggleton find a way to work together and have lots of fun at the same time.(n)</desc>

In India, six-year-old Anushka goes on a journey to meet her family in the countryside. And in Jordan, Hamza, who's seven, makes a kite with his family - and flies it from their roof. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>
