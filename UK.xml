    <desc lang="en">Steph McGovern leads the makers to Wensleydale in the Yorkshire Dales, where they examine the area's famous cheese, as championed by Wallace and Gromit. Focusing on the Monastic period, Jason and Claire try to milk a sheep, while Katie and Charlton extract rennet - an enzyme vital in cheesemaking - from a sheep's stomach. Moving on to the Victorian era, Charlton and Jason tackle the highly physical task of collecting 20 litres of milk each in heavy back cans. The makers are then propelled to the 1920s when early factories employed equipment such as thermometers to produce cheese on a much larger scale.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">WARNING : show starts before 00:00!! Few dispute that the Beatles defined 1960s music and popular culture like no other band, but how John, Paul, George and Ringo made the journey from Merseyside teenagers to international pop stars is less known. Director Alan Byron's documentary recounts the rise of the band as American rock 'n' roll and rhythm and blues dragged post-war Liverpool into one of the most vibrant music cities ever with the Mersey Beat sound.

    <desc lang="en">The story of the craft traditions that put Hull on the map in Britain's industrial heyday. A compass-maker reveals how his precision instruments helped steer the city's fishing fleet, the secret behind the making of fishermen's nets is revealed and a potter talks about his life - and how he fears his craft could be dying out. The film is inspired by The Tool Appreciation Society, artist Linda Brothwell's touring exhibition about tools' connection with the wider word, which can be seen at Hull's Central Library throughout November and December.

    <desc lang="en">Dubbed `The Beast' by Winston Churchill, Tirpitz was Nazi Germany's most powerful battleship. Protected by an elite squadron of fighters, it was seen as invincible, but after 34 failed attempts to sink it, the RAF sent in the 617 `Dambusters' Squadron and 9 Squadron. In a raid in November 1944 they managed to slip through enemy defences and destroy Tirpitz. With eyewitness accounts from surviving RAF crew, one of the Luftwaffe fighter pilots and German sailors, this documentary tells this extraordinary story and offers new evidence to explain the mission's improbable success.(n)</desc>
