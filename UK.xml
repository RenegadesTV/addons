    <desc lang="en">Gary Lineker presents highlights of the first Premier League games of 2019, including Newcastle United v Manchester United at St James' Park and Wolverhampton Wanderers v Crystal Palace at Molineux. The reverse fixture between the Magpies and Red Devils in October was one of the games of the season so far, with Newcastle taking an early 2-0 lead, which they held onto until the 70th minute, when Juan Mata began a remarkable fightback for Jose Mourinho's side. Further goals from Anthony Martial and Alexis Sanchez clinched a dramatic 3-2 win, which some claim saved Mourinho's job. Plus, action from Arsenal v Fulham at the Emirates Stadium, Bournemouth v Watford at the Vitality Stadium, Cardiff City v Tottenham Hotspur at the Cardiff City Stadium, Chelsea v Southampton at Stamford Bridge, Everton v Leicester City at Goodison Park, Huddersfield Town v Burnley at the John Smith's Stadium and West Ham United v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at London Stadium.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gary Lineker presents highlights of the first Premier League games of 2019, including Newcastle United v Manchester United at St James' Park and Wolverhampton Wanderers v Crystal Palace at Molineux. The reverse fixture between the Magpies and Red Devils in October was one of the games of the season so far, with Newcastle taking an early 2-0 lead, which they held onto until the 70th minute, when Juan Mata began a remarkable fightback for Jose Mourinho's side. Further goals from Anthony Martial and Alexis Sanchez clinched a dramatic 3-2 win, which some claim saved Mourinho's job. Plus, action from Arsenal v Fulham at the Emirates Stadium, Bournemouth v Watford at the Vitality Stadium, Cardiff City v Tottenham Hotspur at the Cardiff City Stadium, Chelsea v Southampton at Stamford Bridge, Everton v Leicester City at Goodison Park, Huddersfield Town v Burnley at the John Smith's Stadium and West Ham United v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at London Stadium.(n)</desc>

The reverse fixture between the Magpies and Red Devils in October was one of the games of the season so far, with Newcastle taking an early 2-0 lead, which they held onto until the 70th minute, when Juan Mata began a remarkable fightback for Jose Mourinho's side. Further goals from Anthony Martial and Alexis Sanchez clinched a dramatic 3-2 win, which some claim saved Mourinho's job. Plus, action from Arsenal v Fulham at the Emirates Stadium, Bournemouth v Watford at the Vitality Stadium, Cardiff City v Tottenham Hotspur at the Cardiff City Stadium, Chelsea v Southampton at Stamford Bridge, Everton v Leicester City at Goodison Park, Huddersfield Town v Burnley at the John Smith's Stadium and West Ham United v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at London Stadium.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gary Lineker presents highlights of the first Premier League games of 2019, including Newcastle United v Manchester United at St James' Park and Wolverhampton Wanderers v Crystal Palace at Molineux. The reverse fixture between the Magpies and Red Devils in October was one of the games of the season so far, with Newcastle taking an early 2-0 lead, which they held onto until the 70th minute, when Juan Mata began a remarkable fightback for Jose Mourinho's side. Further goals from Anthony Martial and Alexis Sanchez clinched a dramatic 3-2 win, which some claim saved Mourinho's job. Plus, action from Arsenal v Fulham at the Emirates Stadium, Bournemouth v Watford at the Vitality Stadium, Cardiff City v Tottenham Hotspur at the Cardiff City Stadium, Chelsea v Southampton at Stamford Bridge, Everton v Leicester City at Goodison Park, Huddersfield Town v Burnley at the John Smith's Stadium and West Ham United v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at London Stadium.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tom Kerridge challenges eight families to ditch convenience food and cook from scratch at home, as he believes it will make them fitter, happier and healthier. In the opening episode, Tom meets the eight volunteer families for the first time, and introduces them to the plan he wants them to follow for the next 12 weeks. The first step of his plan is to simply get the families cooking more, and he presents all the families with a starter pack of easy recipes and the ingredients for sausage and mash. Later, Tom prepares two dishes to inspire the group, a tomato salad packed with Mediterranean flavours, and a chicken and peanut stirfry.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Origin</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Somewhere in Spacetime</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The physicist charts the Earth's journey through space, taking to the air in a fighter jet to race the spin of the planet and reverse the passage of the day. In Brazil, a professional surfer rides a monstrous wave surges up the Amazon River, marking the world's constant dance with the Moon, while the harsh winter in Greenland brings opportunity to the Inuit people who live there, and Brian explains how comprehending the motion and speed of Earth brings an understanding of the nature of space and time itself.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The physicist examines the building blocks of life that have been taken from the Earth's elements, including the pure sulphur mined in the heart of a volcano in Indonesia. On a precipitous dam wall in Italy, mountain goats seek out the chemicals essential to their survival, while in a Japanese bay, Brian explains how the dazzling display of thousands of glowing squid shows how life has utilised the planet's chemistry for its own ends.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The physicist concludes his journey by examining the effects of light interacting with the Earth, travelling to Iceland to witness a moonbow - the band of colours released when moonbeams are refracted by the spray of a waterfall. He then visits the site of an enormous outpouring of lava to explain why hot things glow red, and reveals how the different colours of light energy from the sun transform the plains of the Serengeti in Tanzania and drive the migration of humpback whales to the Caribbean each year.(n)</desc>

He begins in the Kalahari desert, Africa's south-west corner, where clever meerkats are outsmarted by a wily bird's use of mimicry, a solitary rhino is seen to exhibit previously unknown sociable behaviours, terrifying insects prey on baby birds and the rarest fish in the world is filmed for the first time. In the neighbouring Namib desert, which receives almost no rain, the competition for scant resources can be fierce, as proven by a ferocious fight for supremacy between two giraffes.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough continues his exploration of the continent in east Africa, which is a haven for life and supports a higher density of large mammals than anywhere else on Earth. From dense forests to snow-capped peaks, steamy swamps to endless savannah, it's also a land of unpredictable extremes, where creatures must adapt to survive. In Tanzania, a tiny lizard risks its life to eat flies from the face of a sleepy lion. The nesting habits of the 4ft shoebill are also captured on camera - the giant bird has two chicks, but due to sibling rivalry only one will survive. On the plains of Amboseli, a baby elephant is near to death in the drought, so its mother leaves the herd to stay with her offspring until the bitter end.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough describes some of the wildlife spectacles of southern Africa, starting out in a little-explored rainforest discovered less than a decade ago by scientists who spotted it on satellite maps. There, thousands of butterflies dance for the right to mate, while on a tiny island off Mozambique, green turtles emerge from eggs and begin a hazardous journey to the water - with pied crows and hungry crabs eager to get them. Cameras also capture one of the largest gatherings of great white sharks on the planet as 30 of the predators circle around a dead whale.</desc>

It's a constant struggle against dehydration, as zebra battle over dwindling rivers, camels search for water and tiny barn swallows navigate thousands of square miles of barren sand to find a life-saving oasis. The naked mole rat avoids the heat by living a subterranean existence, while the silver ant is able to take on the midday sun - but needs a `spacesuit' to do it.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">How animals in the polar regions adapt to the summer weather. In a colony of 400,000 king penguins the adults go surfing and the chicks take mud-baths to cool off, while polar bear cubs take their first swimming lessons as the ice they inhabit melts away. A minke whale is hunted by a family of killer whales, succumbing to their battering after two hours, and Adelie penguins try to prevent their chicks being snatched by skuas.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dubbed `The Beast' by Winston Churchill, Tirpitz was Nazi Germany's most powerful battleship. Protected by an elite squadron of fighters, it was seen as invincible, but after 34 failed attempts to sink it, the RAF sent in the 617 `Dambusters' Squadron and 9 Squadron. In a raid in November 1944 they managed to slip through enemy defences and destroy Tirpitz. With eyewitness accounts from surviving RAF crew, one of the Luftwaffe fighter pilots and German sailors, this documentary tells this extraordinary story and offers new evidence to explain the mission's improbable success.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">In the Footsteps of a Killer</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Another mystery for the cops on the Caribbean island of Saint Marie, where the sun shines all day and it seems half the residents are killers-in-waiting. However, it's all change for the team. Last week they waved goodbye to Humphrey Goodman. No one knows how Kris Marshall's character is bowing out of the show - will he walk off into the sunset with new love Martha, or will he meet a sticky end, like his predecessor Richard Poole (Ben Miller)? What we do know is that in his place is Ardal O'Hanlon as DI Jack Mooney, who first popped up in the two-part London special. His first Caribbean case sees the reopening of a seven-year-old murder when a tourist provides an alibi for the woman convicted of the crime.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The blues legend teams up for the first time in 38 years with former Bluesbreakers Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor as well as jazzman Chris Barber to perform classics from a long and distinguished career. The backbone of the British blues scene since the mid-1960s, John's hard-working band was a nursery for the rock explosion of the 1970s, spawning countless spin-off groups, but always remaining true to the spirit of the roots music and finding new audiences as fashions came and went - as he does in this benefit concert at Liverpool's King's Dock Arena on behalf of Unicef.(n)</desc>

Biologist Patrick Aryee explores how cats have evolved throughout the millennia, learning to thrive in inhospitable environments, as well as becoming the world's most popular pet. In the first edition there is spectacular footage of caracals jumping three metres to catch flying birds, and a rare Bornean bay cat, which was thought to have been extinct. Patrick finds out how tigers made the transition from South-east Asia's steamy jungles to the -40C temperatures of Siberia, and meets `lion whisperer' Kevin Richardson.</desc>

In Belize, he mounts an experiment that showcases the margay's supersharp senses and gravity-defying acrobatics, and heads to the training track with a cheetah to find out what speed it is capable of. Finally, Patrick tells the story of the cat's domestication in Essaouira, Morocco, believed to be one of the first places where one particular species first gave up life in the wild in return for food, warmth, security and a home.</desc>

Not only this, but they always buy big brands and premium supermarket ranges, which is an expensive way to shop for what has become a boring way to eat. Gregg and Chris are determined to help them - but breaking the family's habits isn't going to be easy.</desc>

Mum Lisa is aware she has to make her family more healthy, but is going about it the wrong way, buying into costly `superfoods' rather than good old-fashioned fruit and veg. Can Gregg and Chris help the Guests bring more variety to their plates - and in turn, knock a whopping 50 per cent off their shopping bill? Along the way, they also investigate how canned fish compares to fresh and which oil is best for cooking, as well as the diet cons to watch out for.</desc>

He meets 13-year-old Joey, whose mother Carol is finding it increasingly difficult to cope with his explosive tantrums, 19-year-old Nicky, who has written a novel, and 20-year-old Brian, whose extreme behaviour has led to the decision to place him in residential care.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Wildlife Fund claims there are now more tigers in captivity in America than there are living wild in the rest of the world. Armed with this statistic, Louis Theroux travels stateside to meet people who give house space to animals normally found in Africa and Asia, including big cats and dangerous primates. Among the owners he meets is Joe Exotic, a policeman-turned-animal rescuer who has bred and collected more than 150 tigers, and Connie Casey, who shares her home with her `family' of 20 chimpanzees.</desc>
