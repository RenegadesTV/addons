    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining how, in 1914, the British public demanded that the professional football season be suspended so players could fight in the war. At the time, the Heart of Midlothian squad were enjoying a spectacular run of success, and had recently made their mark as the best side in the country, but were put under extreme pressure to sign up for service. Eleven members of the team enlisted, and a number of them were subsequently killed in the Battle of the Somme. Narrated by Ken Stott, the programme features archive footage and veterans' memoirs, alongside contributions by historian Jack Alexander - who campaigned for a memorial to be erected on the battlefield.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ellie Simmonds: Swimming with Dolphins</title>
    <desc lang="en">The gold-medal winning Paralympic athlete takes a rare break in her extensive training regime to fulfil a childhood dream - to swim with wild dolphins. Since the moment she first learned to swim at the age of three, Ellie has been inspired by the prospect of one day taking to the water alongside these ocean-bound mammals. However, an intense fear of open water means she has never dived in the ocean. Now, she sets out on a journey to conquer her phobias, one that takes her from Cardigan Bay in Wales to southern Mozambique, and the coastal waters of Ponta do Ouro. Along the way, she offers swimming lessons to young orphans, meets champion free-diver Hanli Prinsloo, and has an unexpected encounter with migrating humpback whales.(n)</desc>

Since the moment she first learned to swim at the age of three, Ellie has been inspired by the prospect of one day taking to the water alongside these ocean-bound mammals. However, an intense fear of open water means she has never dived in the ocean. Now, she sets out on a journey to conquer her phobias, one that takes her from Cardigan Bay in Wales to southern Mozambique, and the coastal waters of Ponta do Ouro. Along the way, she offers swimming lessons to young orphans, meets champion free-diver Hanli Prinsloo, and has an unexpected encounter with migrating humpback whales.(n)</desc>

With a rate of 169 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants last year - an average of more than three people each day - Sula has the dubious distinction of being the most dangerous city on the planet outside of a war zone. Ross discovers how armed drug gangs have taken over many parts of the country, forcing thousands to flee north on a freight train that transports migrants through Guatemala and across Mexico into the United States. But it's an arduous journey and not for the faint-hearted. Even if passengers avoid falling off the roof of the train to their deaths, they face being robbed by bandits, raped, murdered or kidnapped and sold into slavery.(n)</desc>

As the series opens, Priscilla White is a Liverpool typist with dreams of escaping the office and becoming a singer. It looks like her chance has come when she meets songwriter Bobby Willis, who claims to be in the music industry - so she's less than impressed to later discover his flash car is hired and he actually works in a bakery. Despite this inauspicious start, Cilla agrees to let him manage her, but will their arrangement still stand after her friends, a local band by the name of the Beatles, help her land an audition with genuine impresario Brian Epstein? Aneurin Barnard, Ed Stoppard and John Henshaw also star.(n)</desc>

The re-emergence of impresario Brian Epstein then propels her career to greater heights, but this is quickly followed by a new low when her first record fails to set the charts alight, despite being written by two local lads called John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Epstein suggests a change of direction, persuading the singer to take a gamble on the ballad Anyone Who Had a Heart, against her future husband's advice.

    <desc lang="en">It looks like Cilla has put that early botched audition and those disappointing record sales behind her as, following the success of Anyone Who Had a Heart, her new single You're My World becomes her second number one. However, while she may have conquered the UK charts, can she follow in the footsteps of her old mates the Beatles and crack America? The signs aren't looking good, and just to add to the pressure, her relationship with Bobby is becoming increasingly tumultuous. But as her manager Brian Epstein's private life starts to spiral out of control, it seems there could be an even bigger threat to Cilla's new-found success. The concluding instalment of Jeff Pope's biopic charting Cilla Black's rise to fame, starring Sheridan Smith, Aneurin Barnard and Ed Stoppard.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Come Dine with Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Bristol, furniture salesman Richard, teacher Anne, paramedic Harriet and IT architect Steve try to outdo each other by throwing the perfect dinner party. As the week progresses, Anne barks at Harriet and recites erotica, while Harriet's ditsy one-liners are a constant amusement for the table. The host on the final night has just one aim - to beat Richard after his restaurant quality meal on night one. In an episode of extreme highs and ravaging lows, expectations are crushed, hidden depths are revealed and criticisms are levelled as the quartet vie for the £1000 prize.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The presenter looks back at some of his favourite builds by the sea, including a multifunctional beach hut in Bournemouth, Dorset, built for less than £400, and a 21st-century update of a Victorian bathing machine in Margate, Kent. George also looks back at some of his favourite waterside retreats in Germany - an extraordinary life guard tower and a holiday home with incredible views across the water - as well as reflecting on the seaside build he undertook with master craftsman Will Hardie that pushed the humble beach hut to its limits by making it float in the open sea.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Up until the 1950s, food was a relatively simple matter, with narrow choice and a constant battle to keep food fresh. Fast forward to the present day and mass production, intensive farming, refrigeration, freezing and food technology have provided more choice and lower prices. However, a sizeable proportion of food is now processed to maintain freshness, leading presenter Philip Boucher-Hayes to ask if people really know what they are eating. In the first edition, the presenter examines how the Irish consumer has changed over the years, and is joined by chef Hilary O'Hagan to look at processed meat products and the Paleo diet.(n)</desc>

Since the moment she first learned to swim at the age of three, Ellie has been inspired by the prospect of one day taking to the water alongside these ocean-bound mammals.

    <desc lang="en">Nick Knowles and his crack team of builders, plasterers and electricians come to the aid of Frank and Christine Burrows in Wigan, Greater Manchester. In 2012, the Burrows' 35-year-old son Mark retrained as a scaffolder to follow in his father's footsteps, but was paralysed as the result of an unprovoked attack that left him with severe brain damage. Mark now needs constant care, but the Burrows' family home is not yet fit for purpose, so Frank and Christine have been forced to take their son to a care home 15 miles away. With the help of flamboyant designer Laurence Llewelyn Bowen, Nick's experts set about constructing a self-contained apartment alongside the Burrows' two-bedroom bungalow, which will provide Nick with the space, independence and security he will need to return home for good after spending two years away.(n)</desc>

What exactly does a head teacher do all day? Taylor Jay and Charlie find out as they investigate on a mission to write and photograph a report for the school website. They are both shocked to discover that their headteacher, Mr French, starts his school day at 6am and he expects Taylor Jay and Charlie to turn up at the same time so they can experience for themselves the long hours which are his routine. It isn't long before Taylor Jay is yawning her way through her classes!.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pokemon: The First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back</title>
    <desc lang="en">Fans of the children's TV series should enjoy this animated adventure, though it might not make much sense to those not already in the know. It follows the efforts of a young hero to become the greatest Pokemon master of all time, but his dangerous quest leads him and his pals to a remote island - where they face their most daunting battle.
