    <desc lang="en">Rob Beckett hosts the musical talent show with a twist, as a range of singers step on-stage for a chance to win a £50,000 cash prize. The judging panel takes the form of `The 100', a large collective of music experts and performers from all over the UK. However, in this talent show, the key to success is encouraging the judges to sing along too, and the more panellists each singer manages to win over, the better their chances of proceeding to the grand final. This week's contestants include a medical student, an HR manager, a West End performer and firefighting brothers, performing tracks by Paloma Faith, Christina Aguilera, Queen, Radiohead, OutKast and Stevie Wonder.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rob Beckett hosts the musical talent show with a twist, as a range of singers step on-stage for a chance to win a £50,000 cash prize. The judging panel takes the form of `The 100', a large collective of music experts and performers from all over the UK.

This week's contestants include a medical student, an HR manager, a West End performer and firefighting brothers, performing tracks by Paloma Faith, Christina Aguilera, Queen, Radiohead, OutKast and Stevie Wonder.(n)</desc>
