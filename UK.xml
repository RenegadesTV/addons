    <title lang="en">Antiques Road Trip</title>
    <desc lang="en">Natasha Raskin Sharp and Philip Serrell scour the antiques shops around Sheffield to find something that will give them the edge at the auction. Natasha goes out of her comfort zone when considering some 18th-century pottery, but feels more at home when she spots something from the 1970s. Philip opts for some typically `Serrell' items, as well as chewing over more prehistoric stuff. He also goes out of his way to prove that chivalry isn't dead. On the road, Philip visits a factory using the world-famous Sheffield steel to make some very fine tools, and Natasha heads to the woods for a spot of foraging and some free food. It's going to be a nail biter at their final auction at Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Antiques Road Trip</title>
    <desc lang="en">Natasha Raskin Sharp and Philip Serrell scour the antiques shops around Sheffield to find something that will give them the edge at the auction. Natasha goes out of her comfort zone when considering some 18th-century pottery, but feels more at home when she spots something from the 1970s. Philip opts for some typically `Serrell' items, as well as chewing over more prehistoric stuff. He also goes out of his way to prove that chivalry isn't dead. On the road, Philip visits a factory using the world-famous Sheffield steel to make some very fine tools, and Natasha heads to the woods for a spot of foraging and some free food. It's going to be a nail biter at their final auction at Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Natasha Raskin Sharp and Philip Serrell scour the antiques shops around Sheffield to find something that will give them the edge at the auction. Natasha goes out of her comfort zone when considering some 18th-century pottery, but feels more at home when she spots something from the 1970s. Philip opts for some typically `Serrell' items, as well as chewing over more prehistoric stuff. He also goes out of his way to prove that chivalry isn't dead. On the road, Philip visits a factory using the world-famous Sheffield steel to make some very fine tools, and Natasha heads to the woods for a spot of foraging and some free food. It's going to be a nail biter at their final auction at Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Antiques Road Trip</title>
    <desc lang="en">Natasha Raskin Sharp and Philip Serrell scour the antiques shops around Sheffield to find something that will give them the edge at the auction. Natasha goes out of her comfort zone when considering some 18th-century pottery, but feels more at home when she spots something from the 1970s. Philip opts for some typically `Serrell' items, as well as chewing over more prehistoric stuff. He also goes out of his way to prove that chivalry isn't dead. On the road, Philip visits a factory using the world-famous Sheffield steel to make some very fine tools, and Natasha heads to the woods for a spot of foraging and some free food. It's going to be a nail biter at their final auction at Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.</desc>

The volunteer pupils attend grammar, representing the one in four children who won a coveted place by passing the 11-plus exam. Here, they delve into teachings on sex education, cycling proficiency, the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and rising incomes in the mid-1950s as well as debates among boys and girls on fighting for your country.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Britain is already the fattest country in Western Europe and if trends continue, more than 50 per cent will be obese by 2050. Last year, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall presented a three-part documentary in which he set out to tackle the national obesity crisis. Now he returns with a final instalment, examining some of the misleading marketing claims on `healthier' products, unveiling the truth about why Brits love to snack and challenging a family to rethink their portion sizes. He also heads to Westminster with Jamie Oliver to talk to MPs about the obesity crisis and gets an opportunity to put his questions directly to the Health Minister.</desc>

Led by presenter Sara Cox and social historian Polly Russell, the volunteers fast-forward through seven different eras, taking them to the end of the 20th century - and in each period there will be new school dinners to try, new trips to take and new ideas about what school is actually for. They begin in Victorian times, where they discover what it was like for the lucky four per cent of children able to attend school at a time when education was still seen as a preserve for the rich but a handful of schools offered affordable places to ordinary families for the first time.</desc>

Among the patients are 22-year-old Sophie, who suffered serious inflammation of the brain stem which means she has to be on a ventilator at night, and Tom, 18, who sustained significant head injuries in a car crash and now struggles to remember the simplest of things. For further rehabilitation, however, he will need private rehabilitation services, and that will require funding.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Britain is already the fattest country in Western Europe and if trends continue, more than 50 per cent will be obese by 2050. Last year, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall presented a three-part documentary in which he set out to tackle the national obesity crisis. Now he returns with a final instalment, examining some of the misleading marketing claims on `healthier' products, unveiling the truth about why Brits love to snack and challenging a family to rethink their portion sizes. He also heads to Westminster with Jamie Oliver to talk to MPs about the obesity crisis and gets an opportunity to put his questions directly to the Health Minister.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fifteen teenagers and three teachers embark on a time-travelling adventure through 100 years of school history. Led by presenter Sara Cox and social historian Polly Russell, the volunteers fast-forward through seven different eras, taking them to the end of the 20th century - and in each period there will be new school dinners to try, new trips to take and new ideas about what school is actually for. They begin in Victorian times, where they discover what it was like for the lucky four per cent of children able to attend school at a time when education was still seen as a preserve for the rich but a handful of schools offered affordable places to ordinary families for the first time.</desc>

With its narrow streets and flights of steps, and a hotel modelled on a 16th-century chateau, the city was the heart of New France and reminds Michael of Paris.

    <desc lang="en">The time-travelling documentary reaches the post-Second World War years, when a revolution in education saw children separated into one of three schools - grammars, secondary moderns and technical. The volunteer pupils attend grammar, representing the one in four children who won a coveted place by passing the 11-plus exam. Here, they delve into teachings on sex education, cycling proficiency, the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and rising incomes in the mid-1950s as well as debates among boys and girls on fighting for your country.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Britain is already the fattest country in Western Europe and if trends continue, more than 50 per cent will be obese by 2050. Last year, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall presented a three-part documentary in which he set out to tackle the national obesity crisis. Now he returns with a final instalment, examining some of the misleading marketing claims on `healthier' products, unveiling the truth about why Brits love to snack and challenging a family to rethink their portion sizes. He also heads to Westminster with Jamie Oliver to talk to MPs about the obesity crisis and gets an opportunity to put his questions directly to the Health Minister.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fifteen teenagers and three teachers embark on a time-travelling adventure through 100 years of school history. Led by presenter Sara Cox and social historian Polly Russell, the volunteers fast-forward through seven different eras, taking them to the end of the 20th century - and in each period there will be new school dinners to try, new trips to take and new ideas about what school is actually for. They begin in Victorian times, where they discover what it was like for the lucky four per cent of children able to attend school at a time when education was still seen as a preserve for the rich but a handful of schools offered affordable places to ordinary families for the first time.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">2019 Second Semi-Final</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Coverage of the second semi-final, played over the best of 11 frames on day seven at Alexandra Palace in London. Despite being an invitational event, this tournament is considered one of the more prestigious on the snooker calendar, and with the winner set to claim a cheque for £200,000, both of the players in this contest will be eager to progress to tomorrow's final. Kyren Wilson produced one of the most memorable comebacks in Masters history at this stage last year, overcoming a 5-2 deficit against Judd Trump to prevail 6-5 and become the first player born in the 1990s to reach a Triple Crown final. Though defeating Mark Allen in the final proved to be a bridge too far, Wilson has gone from strength to strength since his run here, establishing himself in the world's top 10.(n)</desc>

Here, they delve into teachings on sex education, cycling proficiency, the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and rising incomes in the mid-1950s as well as debates among boys and girls on fighting for your country.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Britain is already the fattest country in Western Europe and if trends continue, more than 50 per cent will be obese by 2050. Last year, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall presented a three-part documentary in which he set out to tackle the national obesity crisis. Now he returns with a final instalment, examining some of the misleading marketing claims on `healthier' products, unveiling the truth about why Brits love to snack and challenging a family to rethink their portion sizes. He also heads to Westminster with Jamie Oliver to talk to MPs about the obesity crisis and gets an opportunity to put his questions directly to the Health Minister.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fifteen teenagers and three teachers embark on a time-travelling adventure through 100 years of school history. Led by presenter Sara Cox and social historian Polly Russell, the volunteers fast-forward through seven different eras, taking them to the end of the 20th century - and in each period there will be new school dinners to try, new trips to take and new ideas about what school is actually for. They begin in Victorian times, where they discover what it was like for the lucky four per cent of children able to attend school at a time when education was still seen as a preserve for the rich but a handful of schools offered affordable places to ordinary families for the first time.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Tower Bridge</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">For years, London's East End was denied a new bridge because of the need to guarantee passage of ships up and down the Thames. For years, the greatest engineers of the age hunted for a design that would keep both road and water traffic moving. As Rob Bell explains, the solution came from architect Horace Jones, whose revolutionary design, with its thousand-tonne opening sections, was powered by nothing more than water. Rob also explains the bridge was lucky to survive the Second World War, having been a target for German V-1 flying bombs.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, Anne Diamond, David Aaronovitch, Andrew Collins, Zoe Lyons and Mark Dolan are among the stars revisiting toe-curlingly poor attempts at small-screen comedy. Among the off-colour gags highlighted are 1970s mishaps from Mind Your Language and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, and Heil Honey, I'm Home, the now-infamous 1990 sitcom that tried to transform Adolf Hitler into a comedy character in a disastrously misjudged attempt at irony. Also featured are ITV's disastrous school-based comedy series Hardwicke House, Faith Brown impersonating Rustie Lee on breakfast TV, Ant and Dec's Geordie Christmas special from 1997, and Richard Madeley's woeful turn as Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy creation Ali G - complete with a full costume and painted goatee.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The archaeologists get an opportunity to dig at an army firing range in High Ham, Somerset, to investigate a set of Roman mosaics first discovered 150 years ago. Initial searches suggest the remains of Roman villas could be located on the site, and the team begins to build up a picture of the highs and lows of life in the society of the time - until the cold weather threatens to bring the excavation to a premature halt. Presented by Tony Robinson.</desc>
