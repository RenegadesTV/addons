    <desc lang="en">Coverage of the second semi-final, played over the best of 11 frames on day seven at Alexandra Palace in London. Despite being an invitational event, this tournament is considered one of the more prestigious on the snooker calendar, and with the winner set to claim a cheque for £200,000, both of the players in this contest will be eager to progress to tomorrow's final. Kyren Wilson produced one of the most memorable comebacks in Masters history at this stage last year, overcoming a 5-2 deficit against Judd Trump to prevail 6-5 and become the first player born in the 1990s to reach a Triple Crown final. Though defeating Mark Allen in the final proved to be a bridge too far, Wilson has gone from strength to strength since his run here, establishing himself in the world's top 10.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stacey Dooley presents as the five kids return to the south of England for a taste of some of the shift work done at night by thousands of people across the country. The kids are taken aback to discover that they are joining the cleaning team at a big bus garage in south London. It's hard physical work, and the shift goes on long into the night, requiring them to sweep, mop and wash each double-decker bus by hand. As the job goes on, the youngsters are shocked to discover what passengers have left behind for them to clean up.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Coverage of the second semi-final, played over the best of 11 frames on day seven at Alexandra Palace in London. Despite being an invitational event, this tournament is considered one of the more prestigious on the snooker calendar, and with the winner set to claim a cheque for £200,000, both of the players in this contest will be eager to progress to tomorrow's final. Kyren Wilson produced one of the most memorable comebacks in Masters history at this stage last year, overcoming a 5-2 deficit against Judd Trump to prevail 6-5 and become the first player born in the 1990s to reach a Triple Crown final. Though defeating Mark Allen in the final proved to be a bridge too far, Wilson has gone from strength to strength since his run here, establishing himself in the world's top 10.</desc>

Little could separate the two players until Allen moved 6-5 ahead before notching a break of 119 in the next. Wilson rallied to pull it back to 8-7, but his opponent was able to respond to become the first man from his country to win the title since Dennis Taylor in 1987 and collected a £200,000 prize for his efforts.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Coverage of the second semi-final, played over the best of 11 frames on day seven at Alexandra Palace in London. Despite being an invitational event, this tournament is considered one of the more prestigious on the snooker calendar, and with the winner set to claim a cheque for £200,000, both of the players in this contest will be eager to progress to tomorrow's final. Kyren Wilson produced one of the most memorable comebacks in Masters history at this stage last year, overcoming a 5-2 deficit against Judd Trump to prevail 6-5 and become the first player born in the 1990s to reach a Triple Crown final. Though defeating Mark Allen in the final proved to be a bridge too far, Wilson has gone from strength to strength since his run here, establishing himself in the world's top 10.</desc>

Wilson rallied to pull it back to 8-7, but his opponent was able to respond to become the first man from his country to win the title since Dennis Taylor in 1987 and collected a £200,000 prize for his efforts.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Year of British Murder</title>
    <desc lang="en">Between January 1 and December 31, 2017, 768 people died as a result of murder or manslaughter in Britain - approximately 14 people a week. This documentary tells the stories of some of those cases, following victims' families and friends from the immediate aftermath of the crime, through the court process and beyond, as they try to rebuild their lives. The programme also goes beyond individual incidents to ask what the patterns of murder say about the state of modern Britain.(n)</desc>

As an ambulance crew answers a call to a heart attack, call handlers guide the victim's daughter through administering CPR. A nine-year-old boy is coached through a terrifying situation when his mother suffers a diabetic emergency while driving, and a father-to-be is instructed how to deliver his baby over the phone.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, Anne Diamond, David Aaronovitch, Andrew Collins, Zoe Lyons and Mark Dolan are among the stars revisiting toe-curlingly poor attempts at small-screen comedy. Among the off-colour gags highlighted are 1970s mishaps from Mind Your Language and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, and Heil Honey, I'm Home, the now-infamous 1990 sitcom that tried to transform Adolf Hitler into a comedy character in a disastrously misjudged attempt at irony. Also featured are ITV's disastrous school-based comedy series Hardwicke House, Faith Brown impersonating Rustie Lee on breakfast TV, Ant and Dec's Geordie Christmas special from 1997, and Richard Madeley's woeful turn as Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy creation Ali G - complete with a full costume and painted goatee.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>
