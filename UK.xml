The judging panel takes the form of `The 100', a large collective of music experts and performers from all over the UK.

This week's contestants include a medical student, an HR manager, a West End performer and firefighting brothers, performing tracks by Paloma Faith, Christina Aguilera, Queen, Radiohead, OutKast and Stevie Wonder.(n)</desc>

For more than 50 years they've overcome break-ups and breakdowns to become one of the most successful bands of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide, with their 1977 smash Rumours accounting for nearly half of those sales. Here, fan Edith Bowman provides a narrative overview, alongside fellow celebrity admirers who all pay tribute to the band. Contributors include KT Tunstall, Travis' frontman Fran Healy, Toyah Willcox, Sian Pattenden and Emma Dabiri. Last in the series. (BBC Four/radiotimes.com)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sgt Pepper's Musical Revolution - with Howard Goodall</title>
    <desc lang="en">The composer explores why the Beatles' 50-year-old album is still revered as an innovative, revolutionary and influential release. With the help of out-takes, studio conversations between the band and never-heard-before outside of Abbey Road, Howard gets `under the bonnet' of the album, taking the music apart and reassembling it to reveal how it works. Producer George Martin and his team constructed the album sound by sound, layer by layer - a formula that became the norm for just about every rock act who followed.

The band later re-recorded the songs with a new producer, and they were incorporated into their 1994 album Give Out But Don't Give Up, meaning the originals were left unreleased. With previously unreleased footage of behind-the-scenes studio sessions, this is the story of how the original mix tapes of the album were rediscovered in a basement by Andrew Innes, Primal Scream's rhythm guitarist.
