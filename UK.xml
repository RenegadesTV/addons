    <desc lang="en">Dubbed `The Beast' by Winston Churchill, Tirpitz was Nazi Germany's most powerful battleship. Protected by an elite squadron of fighters, it was seen as invincible, but after 34 failed attempts to sink it, the RAF sent in the 617 `Dambusters' Squadron and 9 Squadron. In a raid in November 1944 they managed to slip through enemy defences and destroy Tirpitz. With eyewitness accounts from surviving RAF crew, one of the Luftwaffe fighter pilots and German sailors, this documentary tells this extraordinary story and offers new evidence to explain the mission's improbable success.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mission: Kill Hitler</title>
    <desc lang="en">A plot to kill the fuhrer that remained secret until the late 1990s. Operation Foxley planned to murder Hitler during his daily morning walk at the Berghof, his Bavarian residence. Two soldiers parachuted into the area were supposed to find a perfect location to shoot Hitler and stop the devastating war. Based on the British Secret Services' declassified documents, using archives and fictionalised reconstitutions, this film recounts the full story and the detailed plan that should have led to the murder of Adolf Hitler, and explains why it failed.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Tarts</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

Though these two rounds provide a stern examination of the amateurs' creative flair and technical ability, they then face possibly the toughest task of the series so far - a six-hour challenge to create a show-stopping layered meringue. Once the sugar has set, who will be this week's Star Baker, and who will be going home? Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

Star pitcher Mumford appears to be an ace up Walnut Grove's sleeve, until his wife discovers the townspeople are betting heavily on the game's outcome. To put a stop to the madness, she benches him, leaving Caroline to persuade Mrs Mumford to allow him to play. The troubles of the Walnut Grove team are not over, however, between arguments of the rightful name of the team, to Sleepy Eye's Green Stockings' win-at-any-cost attitude, the battle for the game is fought in quite an unorthodox manner.(n)</desc>

But his mysterious death at just 19 years of age has never been explained. Now, Dallas Campbell reveals new scientific research aimed at getting to the truth. A CT scan of the pharaoh's mummified body creates a full-size image of the real Tutankhamun, while DNA analysis uncovers a shocking secret about his family background - and the genetic trail leads to a revolutionary new theory about his sudden and unexpected death.(n)</desc>
