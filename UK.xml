    <desc lang="en">Coverage of the conclusion of the final from Alexandra Palace, London, where the first player to reach 10 frames will win the Paul Hunter Trophy. Both players were battling it out for their maiden Triple Crown title in last year's showpiece match, and it was Northern Ireland's Mark Allen who prevailed 10-7 against Kyren Wilson of England. Little could separate the two players until Allen moved 6-5 ahead before notching a break of 119 in the next. Wilson rallied to pull it back to 8-7, but his opponent was able to respond to become the first man from his country to win the title since Dennis Taylor in 1987 and collected a £200,000 prize for his efforts.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Sports</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding assesses the legacies and achievements of Pele, Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King and Tanni Grey-Thompson - four of the 20th century's greatest sport stars. Brazilian footballing legend Pele showed the world that anyone, from any background, could become the world's most renowned sportsperson - if they had the talent - while Ali's boxing skill and charisma secured the love of his fans, but his attitudes towards race, religion and America's role in the Vietnam War all challenged society and meant he was hated by others. As well as being one of the best tennis player of all time, King was also a tireless campaigner for equality. She fought for prize-money parity, was instrumental in the first women's professional tennis tour and founded the Women's Tennis Association. Grey-Thompson was born at a time when the physical and political landscape for disabled people was far from enlightened, and became one of Britain's most successful paralympians.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Coverage of the conclusion of the final from Alexandra Palace, London, where the first player to reach 10 frames will win the Paul Hunter Trophy. Both players were battling it out for their maiden Triple Crown title in last year's showpiece match, and it was Northern Ireland's Mark Allen who prevailed 10-7 against Kyren Wilson of England. Little could separate the two players until Allen moved 6-5 ahead before notching a break of 119 in the next. Wilson rallied to pull it back to 8-7, but his opponent was able to respond to become the first man from his country to win the title since Dennis Taylor in 1987 and collected a £200,000 prize for his efforts.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Icons: The Greatest Person of the 20th Century</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Sports</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding assesses the legacies and achievements of Pele, Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King and Tanni Grey-Thompson - four of the 20th century's greatest sport stars. Brazilian footballing legend Pele showed the world that anyone, from any background, could become the world's most renowned sportsperson - if they had the talent - while Ali's boxing skill and charisma secured the love of his fans, but his attitudes towards race, religion and America's role in the Vietnam War all challenged society and meant he was hated by others. As well as being one of the best tennis player of all time, King was also a tireless campaigner for equality. She fought for prize-money parity, was instrumental in the first women's professional tennis tour and founded the Women's Tennis Association. Grey-Thompson was born at a time when the physical and political landscape for disabled people was far from enlightened, and became one of Britain's most successful paralympians.(n)</desc>

Both players were battling it out for their maiden Triple Crown title in last year's showpiece match, and it was Northern Ireland's Mark Allen who prevailed 10-7 against Kyren Wilson of England. Little could separate the two players until Allen moved 6-5 ahead before notching a break of 119 in the next. Wilson rallied to pull it back to 8-7, but his opponent was able to respond to become the first man from his country to win the title since Dennis Taylor in 1987 and collected a £200,000 prize for his efforts.</desc>

Among the patients are 22-year-old Sophie, who suffered serious inflammation of the brain stem which means she has to be on a ventilator at night, and Tom, 18, who sustained significant head injuries in a car crash and now struggles to remember the simplest of things. For further rehabilitation, however, he will need private rehabilitation services, and that will require funding.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Sports</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding assesses the legacies and achievements of Pele, Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King and Tanni Grey-Thompson - four of the 20th century's greatest sport stars. Brazilian footballing legend Pele showed the world that anyone, from any background, could become the world's most renowned sportsperson - if they had the talent - while Ali's boxing skill and charisma secured the love of his fans, but his attitudes towards race, religion and America's role in the Vietnam War all challenged society and meant he was hated by others. As well as being one of the best tennis player of all time, King was also a tireless campaigner for equality. She fought for prize-money parity, was instrumental in the first women's professional tennis tour and founded the Women's Tennis Association. Grey-Thompson was born at a time when the physical and political landscape for disabled people was far from enlightened, and became one of Britain's most successful paralympians.(n)</desc>

Both players were battling it out for their maiden Triple Crown title in last year's showpiece match, and it was Northern Ireland's Mark Allen who prevailed 10-7 against Kyren Wilson of England. Little could separate the two players until Allen moved 6-5 ahead before notching a break of 119 in the next. Wilson rallied to pull it back to 8-7, but his opponent was able to respond to become the first man from his country to win the title since Dennis Taylor in 1987 and collected a £200,000 prize for his efforts.</desc>

Among the patients are 22-year-old Sophie, who suffered serious inflammation of the brain stem which means she has to be on a ventilator at night, and Tom, 18, who sustained significant head injuries in a car crash and now struggles to remember the simplest of things. For further rehabilitation, however, he will need private rehabilitation services, and that will require funding.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Icons: The Greatest Person of the 20th Century</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Sports</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding assesses the legacies and achievements of Pele, Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King and Tanni Grey-Thompson - four of the 20th century's greatest sport stars. Brazilian footballing legend Pele showed the world that anyone, from any background, could become the world's most renowned sportsperson - if they had the talent - while Ali's boxing skill and charisma secured the love of his fans, but his attitudes towards race, religion and America's role in the Vietnam War all challenged society and meant he was hated by others. As well as being one of the best tennis player of all time, King was also a tireless campaigner for equality. She fought for prize-money parity, was instrumental in the first women's professional tennis tour and founded the Women's Tennis Association. Grey-Thompson was born at a time when the physical and political landscape for disabled people was far from enlightened, and became one of Britain's most successful paralympians.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's a very rainy day at the Go Jet Academy and the Go Jetters are in the training domes teaching the cadets some crucial Go Jetter skills. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch has built his own rival Grim Academy dome on the side of a large, steep hill. He has uprooted trees in order to make room for his Grimdome, but without the roots of trees to hold the soil together the heavy rainfall starts a mudslide down the side of the hill! Mudslides are very powerful and can destroy anything in their path. Glitch and his cadets need rescuing before they are washed away down the hill. (CBeebies/tvguide.co.uk)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On a remote lake in Malaysia, two men mysteriously vanish - just hours apart. Amid rumours that a giant fish is on the loose, biologist and monster-hunter Jeremy Wade sets out to track down the possible culprit.

A trail of evidence leads Jeremy into an ancient rainforest, where an old adversary lies in wait. More than just a beast with a gruesome rap sheet, it's also the one river monster that he has thus far failed to catch.</desc>

A week after 37-year-old baker Frances Barker's body was discovered, lorry driver Thomas Ross Young was arrested, and was subsequently jailed for life. The investigator tries to establish whether the police got the wrong man - or if there could be another explanation.(n)</desc>
