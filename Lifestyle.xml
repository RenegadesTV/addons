A petits fours-making challenge provides an early test of nerves, before the quartet face the toughest technical task in the show's history - creating a fraisier, a sponge cake filled with mousse and strawberries. As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final.

		<desc>After weeks of pastries, cakes and sponges, collapsing gingerbread houses and dodgy doughnuts, there are only three remaining bakers. But only one can be crowned the winner, and to prove they have what it takes the finalists face their most demanding challenges yet. Over two days, they must create a perfect pithivier, or puff-pastry pie, before making fondant fancies and their last showstopper - the notoriously difficult chiffon sponge. Only then will judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry decide who deserves the 2012 title. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins.</desc>

Standing in between them and the title is the challenge of transforming three rooms in an apartment in a stately home located in Sussex. One designer has a disastrous start when their homeowner dislikes all three schemes and asks for a rethink. The other displays some clever ideas, however the judges have doubts and their client dubs some elements of their design as amateurish. As the race for the title nears its end, the pair must try to impress judges Sophie Robinson and Daniel Hopwood, as well as guest judge and iconic interior designer Kelly Hoppen.

The other displays some clever ideas, however the judges have doubts and their client dubs some elements of their design as amateurish. As the race for the title nears its end, the pair must try to impress judges Sophie Robinson and Daniel Hopwood, as well as guest judge and iconic interior designer Kelly Hoppen.
