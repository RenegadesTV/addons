		<desc>Nick Knowles and his crack team of builders, plasterers and electricians come to the aid of Frank and Christine Burrows in Wigan, Greater Manchester. In 2012, the Burrows' 35-year-old son Mark retrained as a scaffolder to follow in his father's footsteps, but was paralysed as the result of an unprovoked attack that left him with severe brain damage. Mark now needs constant care, but the Burrows' family home is not yet fit for purpose, so Frank and Christine have been forced to take their son to a care home 15 miles away. With the help of flamboyant designer Laurence Llewelyn Bowen, Nick's experts set about constructing a self-contained apartment alongside the Burrows' two-bedroom bungalow, which will provide Mark with the space, independence and security he will need to return home for good after spending two years away.</desc>

The Grade II-listed gothic tower has been empty for almost a quarter of a century, the stonework is crumbling, rot is eating the wood and the plaster is beyond repair. A series of unforeseen structural issues starts to eat into the budget, but evidence emerges that the building has a far richer historic pedigree than anyone imagined.</desc>

They hoped to transform the vestry into a spacious three-bedroom home and then get a mortgage to restore the whole building, but the scope of the task and the tightness of their £20,000 budget soon hits home. The historical investigation charts the rise and importance of chapels such as this and how an act passed in the 17th century would fundamentally change the fortunes of worshippers.</desc>
