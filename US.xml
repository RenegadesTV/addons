    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Thriller starring Matt Damon, Greg Kinnear and Jason Isaacs. Director Paul Greengrass fuses his attraction to real-life events with his mastery of full-pelt action to offer this commentary on the Iraq War. US Army officer Roy Miller is thrown into the chaotic vacuum created by Saddam Hussein's removal and the Allies' handling of the immediate aftermath. His mission: to track down those elusive weapons of mass destruction. But, sent on one deadly wild goose chase after another, Miller begins to question the quality of the intelligence directing the operation. Frustrated, he begins to ask awkward questions and is soon being bounced between Poundstone, the Pentagon intelligence officer who insists the WMDs are there to be found, and the CIA's Martin Brown, whose knowledge of the country leads him to a very different conclusion, and Special Forces man Briggs, who appears determined to undermine Miller's efforts. As he digs deeper, Miller begins to piece together the complex relationships and competing ideologies of those around him, as well as the possibility that he has also stumbled upon a political conspiracy..(n)</desc>

The World Missions for Christ Church exists inside a small storefront in Washington, D.C. While the city government lacks funds and power, this little church reaches out to make necessary, positive changes in the community. Homelessness, violence, and drug addiction are all faced head-on by the church members, as missionaries seek out those who have been left behind by poverty and injustice. Peterson presents faith as a force of hope and inspiration within a crumbling, neglected city. Let the Church Say Amen premiered the 2003 SilverDocs Documentary Film Festival and screened at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Woman Thou Art Loosed</title>
    <desc lang="en">One woman's odyssey through a hellish life of sexual abuse, drug addiction, and crime is resolved in faith in this tough but inspiring drama based on a true story documented by evangelist Bishop T.D. Jakes. Michelle Jordan (Kimberly Elise) was raised by a single mother, Cassie (Loretta Devine), who became involved with a cruel and opportunistic man named Reggie (Clifton Powell). Reggie began displaying an inappropriate interest in Michelle when she was only eight, and at 12 he began violating her on a regular basis. Stung by her mother's denials of Reggie's wrongdoings, Michelle ran away from home and ended up on a dead-end road of drug abuse and prostitution, which led to a stretch in prison for murder. While behind bars, Michelle hears of the teachings of Bishop T.D. Jakes and his work with abused women, and writes the noted preacher in hopes of someday meeting him. To her surprise, Jakes (who plays himself) pays her a visit, and as she shares with him the story of her blighted life, she takes the first steps on the road to emotional and spiritual recovery. Jakes arranges for Michelle to have a three-day furlough from prison so she can attend a revival he's hosting in the area; opting to stay in a half-way house rather than see Cassie and Reggie, Michelle reconnects with many of her old friends during her three days of freedom, including former stripper Nicole (Idalis de Leon), childhood friend and hairdresser Twana (Debbi Morgan), and former boyfriend Todd (Michael Boatman)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A World of His Own. The first season Twilight Zone came to a delightful conclusion on July 1, 1960, with this episode, written by Richard Matheson. Coming home early one afternoon, Victoria West (Phyllis Kirk) is shocked to find her playwright husband Gregory West (Keenan Wynn) in the arms of another woman named Mary (Mary LaRoche). When Victoria demands an explanation, Gregory is forced to reveal that Mary was purely a figment of his imagination, "invented" on the writer's tape recorder. To prove this point, Gregory not only makes Mary re-appear, but also a "huge, red-eyed element." But this is not the only surprise in store for the nonplussed Victoria West. The hilarious finale finds series creator Rod Serling joining in on the festivities(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room. Though obviously an episode designed to absorb the costs of the more expensive Twilight Zone installments, this was one of the better efforts of the series' second season, with a tour de force performance by Joe Mantell as penny-ante gangster Jackie Rhoades. Ordered to bump off a rival gangster, the timorous Rhoades tries to summon up the courage for the foul deed, only to be thwarted at every turn by his own conscience -- who as it turns out has more "guts" than Jackie ever dreamed of. Though essentially a solo endeavor, the episode also features a good performance from future producer-director William D. Gordon as Jackie's nasty boss, while another future director, Brian G. Hutton, serves as Joe Mantell's back-to-camera stand-in when the actor "confronts" himself. Written by Rod Serling and scored by Jerry Goldsmith, "Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room" was the first episode produced for Twilight Zone's second season, even though it was telecast as the third episode, on October 14, 1960(n)</desc>

West soon discovers some of the sharks have gotten loose while being transported to a aquarium and are helping themselves to the windsurfers along a once-quiet Hawaiian shoreline. West teams up with Roy Bishop (Daniel Alexander), a veteran shark fisherman from Australia, to capture the deadly creatures before they can claim any more victims; assisting them is Samatha Sharp (Nikita Ager), a beautiful woman whose sister was killed when one of the mutant sharks attacked them while swimming.

On the heels of a difficult season, Joe Conaghey's adopted son Josh decides to transfer schools so he can play with a better ranking team. With his star player gone, the dejected coach's faith takes a major hit. Now the only thing that can bring Josh home to the father who loves him and the teammates who once supported him is trust in the lord, and human compassion(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jennifer's Body</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2009) Megan Fox stars in director Karyn Kusama's (Girl Fight, Aeon Flux) horror satire, from a script by Juno writer Diablo Cody. Student Jennifer Check (Fox) is the stereotypical cheerleader: beautiful, bitchy and adored by all (other than those who are on the receiving end of her cruel wit) at her school in Devil's Kettle. However, local indie band Low Shoulder are more interested in her body than everyone else. In a bid to further their careers, they've made a pact with the Devil: one that requires the soul of a virgin. They kidnap and kill Jennifer, but unfortunately she was no virgin - and she rises again, as a literal man-eater, to take terrible retribution by ravenously rampaging her way through the school. Only one person stands a chance of halting the carnage: Jennifer's best friend Anita 'Needy' Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfried), who's nerdy, for sure, but also may have the strength of character to succeed where others have been ingested..(n)</desc>

There's just one catch: each one wants his girlfriend to be the star. Putting the deal together and keeping the mistress happy turns into a hilarious expose of the truth about Hollywood</desc>

Rowling. Rumor has it that the dreaded Lord Voldemort has returned, but Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) isn't so sure what to make of all the hearsay currently floating around the campus of Hogwarts. Suspecting that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) may be fueling the rumors regarding Voldemort's return in order to undermine his authority and lay claim to his job, Fudge entrusts newly arrived Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) with the task of tracking Dumbledore and keeping a protective watch over the nervous student body. The young wizards of Hogwarts will need something much more effective than Umbridge's Ministry-approved course in defensive magic if they are to truly succeed in the extraordinary battle that lies ahead, however, and when the administration fails to provide the students with the tools that they will need to defend Hogwarts against the fearsome powers of the Dark Arts, Hermione (Emma Watson), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Harry take it upon themselves to recruit a small group of students to form "Dumbledore's Army" in preparation for the ultimate supernatural showdown(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following up his blockbuster action hit Mr. and Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman turns to an entirely new genre -- sci-fi -- for this tale of an underground world of teleporters. Based on the novel by Steven Gould, Jumper concerns David (Hayden Christensen), a young man who quite literally wills himself away from his grim family life by teleporting to another place with the power of his mind. Years later, David is using his powers to raid bank vaults, seduce girls in London, lunch on the pyramids, and surf in Fiji. But he soon discovers that he is not the only one bestowed with this unique gift, and all is not well in the world of jumpers. There are people out there, such as Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), who view jumpers as a threat to all humankind, and have made it their mission in life to eliminate them. After jumping back to Michigan to get reacquainted with his long lost love, Millie (Rachel Bilson), David makes the acquaintance of experienced jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell). Informed by Griffin of a secret between jumpers and a shadowy group that seeks to destroy them, the pair soon finds themselves facing off against a legion of murderous opponents who won't stop fighting until every last jumper has been eliminated</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy working as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award. Also featuring the voices of Keith David, Robert Bailey Jr and Ian McShane(n)</desc>

The setting is Los Angeles, CA, and the event is the wedding between a man and a woman who always seemed destined to be together. Unfortunately, all relationships can't be as healthy as Elise and Michael's is, and though best man and maid of honor Rich (Aaron Stanford) and Samantha (Melissa Sagemiller) seem to be preparing to take the plunge, the same certainly cannot be said for neurotic actress Lana (Mena Suvari). A free-spirited soul who has experienced flings with a variety of wedding attendees including the hapless Pockets (Jon Abrahams), alcoholic actor Simon (James Van Der Beek), and manic children's television program host Donovan (Ethan Embry), Lana attempts to sort out her past flings as lovelorn agent Quentin (Colin Hanks) pines for the bride's sister and the estranged father of the groom attempts to reconnect with his long-lost son</desc>

Blitz, like his onscreen alter ego, struggled with a stammer as a young man -- a disability he eventually surmounted -- which imparted him with a lifelong interest in speech and storytelling</desc>

But Vostrikov, Polenin and K-19's loyal crew can never imagine all that is expected of them.

Given that Clyde was trained as a hypnotist while in the military, the pair decide to con mobster Biggie Smalls (Calvin Lockhart) by placing a high-stakes bet on a boxing match and then using hocus-pocus to transform skinny underdog Bootney Farnsworth (Jimmie Walker) into a bruiser. When Biggie finds out about their ruse, he and his thugs move in to reclaim their money, setting the stage for further laughs and sleight-of-hand. With a supporting cast that includes Denise Nicholas and Lee Chamberlin as the protagonists' wives and Ossie Davis as an elder at their lodge, Let's Do It Again also reunited Good Times stars Walker and John Amos to the silver screen. Cosby and Poitier would return two years later with A Piece of the Action, though Lockhart, another veteran of Uptown Saturday Night, would sit out the final team-up. Hip-hop fans will note that Lockhart's character provided one of the aliases for slain '90s rap star Christopher Wallace, also known as the Notorious B.I.G. The soundtrack for Let's Do It Again featured Curtis Mayfield songs performed by the the Staple Singers(n)</desc>

These men get together to lend one another emotional support. However, the means they choose for this do not enhance their sensitivity or their judgement. When one of them has a really bad day, he asks his buddies to come to "choir practice," and they get together for alcoholic benders of fairly epic proportions. When one of them accidentally shoots a homosexual teen cruising a city park, everyone (including higher-ups) gets called on to help with the cover-up. The Choirboys, which was a critical and box-office failure, had an impressive cast list, including such well-known performers as Blair Brown, James Woods, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett Jr., Perry King and Charles Durning(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tin Cup</title>
    <desc lang="en">Golfing drama about a washed-up old pro who tries to get back into the big time. Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy (Kevin Costner) ruined his career when he took a risk on the golf course which led to his disqualification from the game. Now he teaches golf to others at a driving range in Salome, Texas, with the help of his trusted friend Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin). But McAvoy's life starts to change when a new student walks into the training centre - Dr Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), who just happens to be dating PGA star David Simms (Don Johnson). To win Molly, 'Tin Cup' knows that he must impress her - and what better way than by beating Simms and winning the US Open? The problem, of course, is that 'Tin Cup' has been teaching golf for so long that he may have forgotten how to play!(n)</desc>

Returning to the site of a transport accident which occured eight years earlier, Riker comes face to face with an exact double of himself. Living alone for those many years, the "early" Riker still harbors a love for Deanna Troi. As Geordi tries to solve the mystery of the twin Rikers, the "later" Riker tries to reconcile his present feelings for Troi with the ardor expressed by his alter ego. "Second Chances" was written by Rene A. Echavarria, from a story by Michael A. Medlock</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Descent, Part I. As had been the case on four previous occasions, Next Generation ended its sixth season with the first half of a two-part cliffhanger. First telecast June 26, 1993, part one of "Descent" finds the Borg returning for another duel with the Federation. This time, the Borg boasts a new and very hostile "individuality," and this revelation causes Data to experience his very first emotion. As the episode draws to a close, it looks as if Data, now under the spell of his evil Borg brother Lore, has crossed over to the other side, snarling "The sons of Soong have joined together, and together we will destroy the Federation!" Could there have been any doubt at this point that the loyal Next Generation fans would not return on September 25, 1993, to witness the outcome of this pulse-pounder? Scripted by Ronald D. More from a story by Jeri Taylor, part one of "Descent" boasted the extra added attraction of having several famous scientists, including Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, appearing in "cameo roles," with one of these notables, physicist Stephen Hawking, playing himself(n)</desc>
