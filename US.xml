    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser. TMZ on TV was seen primarily on local Fox or Fox-owned affiliates throughout the U.S</desc>

Helmut takes Bender under his wing and trains him to be a master chef by giving him a secret weapon - a crystal vial containing "the pure essence of flavor". A now confident Bender challenges Elzar to a competition in the televised kitchen coliseum known as the "Iron Cook" show</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An all-star cast of action-movie icons headline Sylvester Stallone's explosive action thriller about a group of hard-nosed mercenaries who are double-crossed during a treacherous mission. Approached by the shadowy Church (Bruce Willis) to overthrow tyrannical South American dictator General Gaza (David Zayas) and restore order to the troubled island country of Vilena, stoic soldier of fortune Barney Ross (Stallone) rounds up an unstoppable team that includes former SAS soldier and blade specialist Lee Christmas (Jason Statham); martial arts expert Yin (Jet Li); trigger-happy Hale Caesar (Terry Crews); and cerebral demolitions expert Toll Road (Randy Couture). Traveling to Vilena on a reconnaissance mission with his old pal Christmas, Barney meets their local contact, a cagey guerrilla fighter named Sandra (Giselle Itie), and together the trio scopes out the landscape.. It isn't long before Barney and Christmas have discovered that their actual target is not General Gaza but James Monroe (Eric Roberts), a former CIA operative who has recently gone rogue. Monroe won't be easy to get to either, because his hulking bodyguard Paine (Steve Austin) is a force to be reckoned with. When their mission is compromised, Barney and Christmas are forced to flee, leaving Sandra behind to face almost certain death. But Barney isn't the kind of soldier to abandon a mission, or a hostage, and now in order to get the job done he'll need the help of his old crew</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A structural security expert must escape from a prison that was built based on his own designs in order to track down the person who framed him in this gritty action thriller starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. B&amp;C Security founder Ray Breslin (Stallone) wrote the book on structural security. His encyclopedic knowledge of the subject has transformed the prison industry, and he's been known to test his theories by allowing himself to be incarcerated just to examine his work from the inside. Along with his business partner Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio), trusted associate Abigail Ross (Amy Ryan), and resourceful technology expert Hush (Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson), Breslin makes a good living escaping from the world's toughest prisons. When Breslin's team is approached by a CIA lawyer (Caitriona Balfe) with a proposal to test an off-the-grid penitentiary, the challenge (and the sizable paycheck) is impossible to resist. From the moment Breslin is picked up by a team of murderous private contractors, however, it's obvious something has gone horribly wrong. Later, when Breslin regains consciousness in The Tomb -- a highly fortified prison based on his own design -- it quickly becomes apparent he's been set up. Warden Hobbs (Jim Caviezel) runs The Tomb with ruthless efficiency, and his team of masked guards is quick to make an example of unruly inmates. At first it looks as if Breslin has finally been beaten at his own game, but then he meets Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) -- a convict who's equally tough, and equally determined to regain his freedom. If Breslin and Rottmayer can just survive long enough to formulate a plan, they've got a fighting chance. But should they fail, they will both perish in a hell that was constructed as a place where people go to disappear forever</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Expendables</title>
    <desc lang="en">An all-star cast of action-movie icons headline Sylvester Stallone's explosive action thriller about a group of hard-nosed mercenaries who are double-crossed during a treacherous mission. Approached by the shadowy Church (Bruce Willis) to overthrow tyrannical South American dictator General Gaza (David Zayas) and restore order to the troubled island country of Vilena, stoic soldier of fortune Barney Ross (Stallone) rounds up an unstoppable team that includes former SAS soldier and blade specialist Lee Christmas (Jason Statham); martial arts expert Yin (Jet Li); trigger-happy Hale Caesar (Terry Crews); and cerebral demolitions expert Toll Road (Randy Couture). Traveling to Vilena on a reconnaissance mission with his old pal Christmas, Barney meets their local contact, a cagey guerrilla fighter named Sandra (Giselle Itie), and together the trio scopes out the landscape.. It isn't long before Barney and Christmas have discovered that their actual target is not General Gaza but James Monroe (Eric Roberts), a former CIA operative who has recently gone rogue. Monroe won't be easy to get to either, because his hulking bodyguard Paine (Steve Austin) is a force to be reckoned with. When their mission is compromised, Barney and Christmas are forced to flee, leaving Sandra behind to face almost certain death. But Barney isn't the kind of soldier to abandon a mission, or a hostage, and now in order to get the job done he'll need the help of his old crew</desc>

Thus begins one of the most popular and critically acclaimed episodes of the series. Frasier's Jane Leeves returns as Marla the virgin, one of the many tempters who also include John F. Kennedy Jr. and a nubile nurse and patient in George's mother's hospital room. Originally broadcast November 18, 1992, "The Contest" was the 11th episode of the show's fourth season</desc>

    <title lang="en">Knowing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nicolas Cage stars in Australian director Alex Proyas's science fiction thriller about the discovery of a series of deadly prophecies. Back in 1959, a Boston school buried a time capsule containing the pupils' imaginings of what life would be like in the future; most contributions were in the form of pictures, but one was very different. Now, 50 years later, the experiment has been dug up, and the predictions distributed among the school's current students; the oddity - a long list of numbers that baffles everyone - is given to Caleb Koestler, who takes it home. When Chandler's scientist dad, John, takes a look at it he realises that the list details a series of lethal events, all but three of which have already happened. Convinced he's right, John sets out to both prove his theory and stop the impending disasters. But little does he know the danger he, his family and everyone around him are in..(n)</desc>

During her last week in Tinseltown, Lucy (Lucille Ball) is determined to get her hands on a valuable souvenir.

But grabbing Wayne's prints isn't as difficult a task as returning them, as Lucy and Ethel (Vivian Vance) learn to their dismay.

Alas, Lucy won't be able to get a passport until she produces her birth certificate -- which she can't. But there's good news from the passport officials: if Lucy can provide at least two people willing to verify that they've known her since birth, she can cut through the bureaucracy. However, the witnesses fall through, leaving Lucy no other option but to try to stow away on the Europe-bound ocean liner -- and this leads to the classic slapstick set piece wherein Lucy is locked in a steamer trunk(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Lost in Translation</title>
    <desc lang="en">This highly acclaimed, Oscar(R) winning independent drama marked the extraordinary sophomore effort of writer and director Sofia Coppola, who crafts a resonant, understated drama about a movie star (Bill Murray) visiting Tokyo to appear in a liquor commercial, who befriends the lonely, hotel-bound wife (Scarlett Johansson) of a celebrity photographer. Together, the two lost, culturally adrift, insomniac Americans become platonic soul mates, exploring the city and discovering a kindred spirit to combat their shared isolation</desc>

Desperate, they decide to move to Atlanta and stay with George's obnoxious brother until they can get back on their feet. Along the way, however, they find themselves venturing into Elysium, a small, free-spirited community where money has no value, clothes are strictly optional, and everyone works together to make life more meaningful. It's the perfect place for a stressed-out couple like George and Linda to breathe deep and put their lives into perspective. But will they remain in Elysium, or will the many temptations of the modern world ultimately prove too attractive to resist?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When the concerned father of an autistic young girl decides to forcefully remove his daughter from the hospital where she is currently being treated, his mission is unexpectedly complicated by a horde of murderous creatures that seem to have found their way into our reality from some frightening parallel universe. It was supposed to be so simple: the father would locate his daughter and spring her from the hospital before the staff even knew what was happening. After getting trapped in the elevator on their way out, however, events take a horrifically grim turn as the doors open to reveal that the once sterile and bustling surroundings are now ominously silent and dank. With mutilated bodies strewn about and murderous gang of monsters stalking them through an endless maze of corroded hallways, the only remaining hope for the frightened father and daughter now lies in the affected mind of a little girl who may understand more about the situation than anyone realizes(n)</desc>

Mac (Steve Lemme), Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Foster (Paul Stoter), and Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske) are four Vermont state troopers whose dedication to duty is not exactly an inspiration to law enforcement officers everywhere. Stationed in a small town near the Canadian border, the troopers don't have much to do, so they while away their hours smoking dope and harassing hapless motorists. Their superior officer, Capt. O'Hagan (Brian Cox), likes the boys and they try to keep their more outrageous antics out of his earshot, but they often run afoul of fellow trooper Farva (Kevin Heffernan), who insists on doing things by the book. When Governor Jessman (Lynda Carter) announces massive budget cuts for Vermont law enforcement personnel, things look bad for the troopers and they must quickly prove their worth or they'll be forced to look for real jobs. Appropriately enough, the troopers stumble upon some information regarding a group of marijuana dealers operating along the border; the guys figure this is just the sort of high-profile bust that could save their careers, but the police department of a nearby town gets wind of the troopers' plans. The Earlville police are no friends of the troopers, and they set out to ruin their moment of glory. Super Troopers was written by the five-man comedy troupe Broken Lizard, who also star as the five troopers; the group's leader, Jay Chandrasekhar, directed(n)</desc>

Chas and his father Stu (voice of Jack Riley) were hired to create a bevy of electronic critters for the newly opened Euro-Reptarland theme park, but the robots are acting up, and park manager Coco La Bouche (Susan Sarandon) is hopping mad. So Stu and Chas are flown to Paris to do some repairs, with Chas bringing Chuckie and all his friends along.

Giving chase, Scudder kills the robbers in the street, though a stray bullet turns a heroic moment tragic. Devastated, Scudder subsequently goes to work as an unlicensed private detective, working just outside of the law and surviving on generous gifts offered in exchange for his services. Now, tasked with rooting out the sadistic thugs who brutally murdered the wife of a wealthy drug dealer (Dan Stevens), Scudder scours the bars and back alleys of New York City in search of his elusive targets -- and the closer he gets, the more apparent it becomes that they are something much more sinister than your typical kidnappers(n)</desc>

But the torments that plagued his days - perhaps the ones that drove him to paint in the first place - haunted him for his whole life. 'Pollock' won one Oscar and the TFCA Award at the Toronto Film Critics Association Awards, 2001</desc>

    <desc lang="en">First-time screenwriter Stelios Pavlou enjoyed a major success with this script that he wrote while working in an English liquor store by sending it to actor Samuel L. Jackson, who signed on for one of the lead roles. Jackson is Elmo McElroy, a kilt-wearing, golf club-wielding Los Angeles native who has invented an illegal drug formula that he hopes will provide him with a last major score of 20 million dollars before he retires from a life of crime. He travels to Liverpool, England, where he hopes to find a buyer for his creation among the denizens of the city's rave scene, but his plans go awry when those who are in on the deal start turning up dead. Elmo's only protector is a chain-smoking, Yank-hating local hood named Felix De Souza (Robert Carlyle), who reluctantly partners with the violence-prone American to finish the deal and cash in, sparking a gang war between Elmo's vengeful one-time employer, The Lizard (Meat Loaf); Felix's boss, Durant (Ricky Tomlinson); crooked cop Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); a beautiful assassin, who also happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer); and an offbeat, yoga-practicing nightclub owner and mobster named Iki (Rhys Ifans).

Following a disastrous incident involving a Velcro jump suit at Milan Fashion Week, Brüno is fired from his TV show Funkyzeit mit Brüno, turns his back on fashion, and heads off to America, hoping to become more famous than Hitler (though for different reasons, naturally). Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a TV chat show audience via various homophobic bigots to a Texan Congressman. And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs. However, there is consensus that this is a very, very funny film, albeit one not for the faint-hearted. Directed by Larry Charles. English and German with English subtitles(n)</desc>

Following a disastrous incident involving a Velcro jump suit at Milan Fashion Week, Brüno is fired from his TV show Funkyzeit mit Brüno, turns his back on fashion, and heads off to America, hoping to become more famous than Hitler (though for different reasons, naturally). Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a TV chat show audience via various homophobic bigots to a Texan Congressman. And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs. However, there is consensus that this is a very, very funny film, albeit one not for the faint-hearted. Directed by Larry Charles. English and German with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Office Space</title>
    <desc lang="en">Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a computer programmer working for Initech in Houston. Every day, he and his friends Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman as not THAT Michael Bolton), suffer endless indignities and humiliations in their soulless workspace from their soulless boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). For Peter, stuck in his cookie-cutter apartment with paper-thin walls and IKEA furniture, every day is worse than the one before it -- so every day is the worst of his life. To cap it off, Initech has hired a pair of "efficiency experts" to downsize the company. One Friday night, Peter's soon to be ex-girlfriend Anne (Alexandra Wentworth) forces him to go to an occupational hypnotherapist to relieve work stress. While Peter is under hypnosis, the therapist keels over and dies. As he never snaps out of his hypnotic state, Peter has a new outlook on life. If something annoys him, he just ignores it or walks away from it. He is completely relaxed and enjoying life for the first time in a long time. On Monday, Peter skips work and sleeps in. He gets up for lunch and drives down to a restaurant next to his office and asks the waitress he's had a crush on, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), on a date. When Peter stops into the office to pick up his organizer, he's called in to talk to the efficiency experts. Relaxed and friendly, Peter charms them as he describes everything wrong with the office, including his boss. Even as Peter now appears at work only as the mood strikes him, the experts decide he's management material and give him a promotion even as they lay off the hardworking Samir and Michael. Peter then convinces his friends to exact revenge on Initech based upon an idea from Superman III. Not everything works out quite as planned. Office Space originated from writer/director Mike Judge's first animated short of the same name, created in 1991. The short was about Milton (reproduced in the film by Stephen Root), a damaged office drone whose complaints and threats about his sufferings go unheeded</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day After Tomorrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster stars Dennis Quaid as climatologist Jack Hall; a lone voice predicting that global warming will lead to a new ice age. He is ridiculed for his views, but his fears swiftly come true when a dramatic temperature rise in the Antarctic causes the world's weather to go mad, with tornadoes devastating Los Angeles, Britain literally flash-frozen and New York first inundated by floods and then overwhelmed by a killer cold snap. A few survivors, including Jack's son Sam, take refuge in a library and Jack sets out on a desperate mission to save them. The action-packed film (which won a BAFTA for its stunning special effects) may have compressed and dramatised the effects of global warming but, disturbingly, the basic science Emmerich uses in the film to advance the plot isn't that far removed from the increasing dangers the world faces today(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Flight of the Phoenix</title>
    <desc lang="en">The eldest son of a 1950s-era Midwestern family sets out on an existential journey that leads him to question his faith while seeking the answers to life's most challenging mysteries in this evocative drama from celebrated director Terrence Malick.Meanwhile, as Jack's innocence slowly erodes, his turbulent relationship with his father becomes the specter that hangs over his every thought and action. Giovanni Ribisi plays Elliott, the enigmatic engineer who persuades the survivors they can scavenge enough from the crashed plane to build another to fly them to safety while, unlike in the original, a love interest is provided by Miranda Otto as the tough yet vulnerable Kelly. Superbly photographed by Brendan Galvin, this stands against the original, with the mix of characters providing the drama and the take-off of the cobbled-together aircraft a nail-biting climax(n)</desc>

But Tony Stark has a surprise up his sleeve in the form of four amazing teenagers who just might have the power to defeat Ultron once and for all. But will James (son of Captain America and Black Widow), Pym (son of Wasp and Giant Man), Torunn (daughter of Thor) and Azari (son of the Black Panther) truly be capable of defeating the villain who brought about the downfall of their powerful parents? As the battle gets underway and Hawkeye's sharp-shooting son leaps into the fray, the team realizes that they might stand a fighting chance if they can only track down the mission Hulk and encourage him to become a member of the team. Should they succeed in defeating Ultron, this group will forever be known as The Next Avengers(n)</desc>
