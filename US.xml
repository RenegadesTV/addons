    <desc lang="en">An upstanding businessman finds his upcoming marriage thrown into question when his connection with a down-on-her-luck cleaning woman turns unexpectedly romantic. Wesley Deeds (Tyler Perry) is a prominent businessman who has successfully taken the reins of the family business. He displays commendable patience while dealing with his insubordinate brother and strives to give his demanding fiancée, Natalie (Gabrielle Union), a happy, stable future. Up until now, Wesley's life has been comfortable, but the moment he meets Lindsey (Thandie Newton), everything starts to change. A proud single mother who has just gotten evicted and now struggles to give her daughter some much-needed stability, Lindsey never asked for a handout in her life. But when Wesley offers to lend the outspoken custodian the help that she needs to get her life back together, their friendly bond quickly develops into something much deeper. Now, with his heart and his head pulling in different directions, Wesley realizes that his entire future may not be as predictable as he once thought(r)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Love Jones</title>
    <desc lang="en">What do you do after love at first sight? That's the question posed in this romantic comedy-drama set in Chicago. Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) is a novelist who is giving a reading at the Sanctuary, an upscale club presenting jazz and poetry to a bohemian clientele. Shortly before his set, he meets Nina Mosley (Nia Long), a woman who is a gifted photographer, despite the fact that she just lost her job. They exchange small talk, and Darius makes his interest clear when -- on the spot -- he retitles a love poem "A Blues For Nina." A mutual attraction is sparked between them; soon Darius finds Nina's address on a check and shows up unannounced at her apartment, a visit resulting in a photo session that turns seriously sexy. So far, so good, but neither Darius or Nina are sure where to go next after this promising start. She's just gotten out of a relationship and isn't sure if she still cares for her old boyfriend or not, while Darius' buddies read him the riot act for wanting to give up his freedom so early on in the game. Love Jones was the debut feature for African-American writer and director Theodore Witcher; Isaiah Washington, Bill Bellamy, and Lisa Nicole Carson lead the supporting cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Trouble with Templeton. The past and present collide with poignant results in this handsomely mounted Twilight Zone episode. Brian Aherne stars as aging Broadway matinee idol Booth Templeton, who is unable to give his full attention to his latest play because of his obsession with the past in general and his late wife Laura (Pippa Scott) in particular. Miraculously, Templeton is transported back to the 1920s for a reunion with his beloved Laura, which proves to be an eye-opener in more ways than one. Future film director Sydney Pollack is cast here as an abrasive stage director named Willis, a character whom scriptwriter E. Jack Neuman and director Buzz Kulik patterned after pioneer live-TV producer Fred Coe. "The Trouble with Templeton" was first telecast on December 9, 1960(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A man struggling to come to terms with the sins of his father makes the terrible discovery that his own son has fallen into a life of crime in a drama based on a true story. Vincent LaMarca (Robert DeNiro) is a dedicated and well-respected New York City police detective who has gone to great lengths to distance himself from his past; four decades earlier, Vincent's father Angelo killed a young child, and since then Vincent has carried emotional scars from this incident that he refuses to show to the world. Vincent lives alone in a small apartment building, though he has nurtured a close if tentative relationship with his downstairs neighbor, Michelle (Frances McDormand). One day, Vincent and his partner, Reg Duffy (George Dzundza), are assigned to investigate a murder when the body of a young man is found dead in a dumpster. It turns out the body was that of a drug dealer, and the dealer's partner in crime, Spyder (William Forsythe), believes the killer was one of his regular customers -- a junkie would-be musician who calls himself Snake (Brian Tarantina). City By the Sea was adapted from a piece by journalist Mike McAlary which first appeared in Esquire magazine; the cast also includes Eliza Dushku and Anson Mount(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale star in writer-director Stephen Sommers' breathless, all-action roller-coaster of a CGI monster-hunt. It's the late 19th century and a secret organisation within the Vatican is determinedly pursuing its ages-old mission to ensure the extinction of all supernatural beings that threaten mankind. Their star creature-killer is Gabriel Van Helsing, who starts the movie in Paris, where he's on the trail of a rampaging Mr Hyde. Van Helsing is then dispatched to Transylvania, where his assignment is to assist Princess Anna Valerious in her long-standing quest to defeat Count Dracula. Van Helsing is abetted by the ingenious but timid and risk-averse Carl, who churns out a stream of gadgets and weapons (much in the manner of James Bond's inventor Q) for our warrior hero. But the undead nobleman awaits them, and he has forged an unlikely but deadly alliance with other supernaturals... It's not the most intellectually challenging of films, but it's certainly a thrilling horror-tinged fairground ride(n)</desc>

Terry (Shemar Moore), Jackson (Morris Chestnut), Brian (Bill Bellamy), and Derrick (D.L. Hughley) are four close friends who get together once a week to play basketball and compare notes on their problems with women. And as it turns out, they have a lot to say in that area. Terry has just gotten engaged to BeBe (Susan Dalian), who is more than a bit controlling. Jackson has a deep fear of commitment, symbolized by a recurring dream in which he's attacked by women wearing wedding gowns; what's more, he's started seeing Denise (Gabrielle Union), who he learns once had a fling with his dad (Clifton Powell). Brian is a lawyer who has discovered his next court date will see him pleading a case in front of a judge who used to be his girlfriend (Angelle Brooks). And Derrick's marriage to Sheila (Tamala Jones) is falling apart at the seams. The Brothers also features one-time Jeffersons regular Marla Gibbs, and Jennifer Lewis as Jackson's mother, who may be giving his father a second chance after many years apart</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Astronaut Farmer</title>
    <desc lang="en">An aspiring astronaut who was forced to forsake his dream of exploring space in order to save the family farm begins building his own personal rocket as a means of reaching the stars in this quirky rural drama starring Billy Bob Thornton. There once was a time when Charlie Farmer (Thornton) seemed like a shoo-in for NASA's esteemed astronaut training program. An Air Force pilot who held a degree in aerospace engineering, Charlie was well on his way to blasting off when a family crisis grounded his celestial aspirations. Of course, Charlie's feet may be firmly planted on terra firma these days, but his thoughts are constantly ascending into the clouds and beyond. It's been ten long years since the man who would navigate the stars began tending to the family farm, and during that time, Charlie has dedicated every moment of his spare time to building the rocket that will one day launch him into space. Though his devoted wife, Audie (Virginia Madsen), the pair's three children, Sunshine, Stanley, and Shepard, and even his father-in-law, Hal (Bruce Dern), all support Charlie in achieving his lifelong goal of becoming the nation's first independent astronaut, a last-minute hitch on the eve before the big launch unexpectedly stalls Charlie's countdown. It seems that Charlie's quest to obtain a substantial amount of high-grade rocket fuel has attracted the attention of not only the FBI, but the CIA, the FAA, and the United States military as well. Now, as the powers that be attempt to ground Charlie, citing concerns for civilian safety, a media frenzy descends upon the once-quiet farm as the reluctant renegade hero vows to show his children just how far one's courage and willingness to pursue one's own ideals can get a person when one refuses to give up hope. Northfork writing/directing duo Mark and Michael Polish team up to tell the tale of a man considered an oddity by his neighbors, a criminal by the government, and an inspiration by the media and the people</desc>

    <desc lang="en">First-time screenwriter Stelios Pavlou enjoyed a major success with this script that he wrote while working in an English liquor store by sending it to actor Samuel L.

He travels to Liverpool, England, where he hopes to find a buyer for his creation among the denizens of the city's rave scene, but his plans go awry when those who are in on the deal start turning up dead. Elmo's only protector is a chain-smoking, Yank-hating local hood named Felix De Souza (Robert Carlyle), who reluctantly partners with the violence-prone American to finish the deal and cash in, sparking a gang war between Elmo's vengeful one-time employer, The Lizard (Meat Loaf); Felix's boss, Durant (Ricky Tomlinson); crooked cop Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); a beautiful assassin, who also happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer); and an offbeat, yoga-practicing nightclub owner and mobster named Iki (Rhys Ifans).

    <desc lang="en">In what is widely regarded as his best film, Steven Seagal plays lowly Navy chef Casy Ryback on board the USS Missouri, a nuclear-armed battleship. But when the ship is seized by terrorist William Stranix and renegade officer Commander Krill, Ryback reveals his true identity: he's an ex-navy SEAL seeing out his time as a chef after an 'incident'. Now Ryback must use all his old skills to take on the baddies. Andrew Davis's all-action film co-stars Erika Eleniak as Jordan Tate, Playboy's Miss July 1989, who tags along with Ryback for safety, and acts as a foil for the humorous spats between the pair in the rare moments between the kick-ass action(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Labyrinth of Lies</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this historical drama, idealistic German public prosecutor Johann Radmann (Alexander Fehling) becomes interested in the case of Charles Schulz, a former Nazi officer at Auschwitz who is now a schoolteacher. Radmann initially encounters resistance from the rest of his department when he begins his investigation, but senior prosecutor Walter Friedberg (Robert Hunger-Buhler) ultimately allows him to build as many cases as possible against the 8000 people who worked at the death camp. Helmed by first-time feature-film director Giulio Ricciarelli, Labyrinth of Lies is based on the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, a previously lesser-known chapter of Germany's post-WWII history in which the country was forced to reckon with the Nazis who returned to everyday life following the end of the war. Germany's official Foreign Language submission for the 2016 Academy Awards. Friederike Becht, Andre Szymanski, and Hansi Jochmann co-star</desc>

    <title lang="en">CJ7</title>
    <desc lang="en">Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle director Stephen Chow returns to the helm for this sci-fi comedy about a struggling single father whose quest to find the perfect toy yields out-of-this-world results. Ti (Chow) is a poor construction worker who breaks his back to ensure that his young son Dicky (Xu Jiao) can stay enrolled in an exclusive private school. But while Ti does everything possible to give his son the opportunities that he never had, Dicky still feels like a classroom reject due to his tattered clothes and lack of the latest toys. Dicky's classmates all play with the coolest and most expensive gadgets that money can buy, so how is a kid who gets his toys from the local junkyard ever supposed to fit in? One day, while scrounging through the trash heap in search of a new toy, Ti discovers a mysterious orb and brings it straight back to Dicky. Though at first the "CJ7" appears to be little more than an unidentifiable oddity, it proves to be much, much more once the young boy starts to play with it. This isn't your average action figure, but a living "pet" with extraordinary powers. Realizing that his new toy may be just the thing to help him fit in with his demanding classmates, Dicky brings the CJ7 to school with him in order to show it off and have some fun. But the CJ7 has its own ideas about how to have fun, and it isn't long before the situation at school gets hopelessly out of hand(n)</desc>

Eager to show his father that he can succeed, Seth lands a job with a small stock brokerage firm. He is given a space in the company's "boiler room," where he makes cold calls to prospective clients. As it turns out, Seth has a genuine talent for cold calling, which gains him the approval of his superiors, the admiration of his father, and the attentions of one of his co-workers, Abby Hilliard (Nia Long).

However, on prom night, Ted gets his penis caught in his zipper, so the much-desired date never happens. Living in Providence and waxing nostalgic 13 years later, Ted hires Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to locate Mary, and the creepy private investigator finds her in Miami, where she lives with her tan-shriveled roommate Magda (Lin Shaye). After Pat develops a stalker-style fixation on the lovely, unattached Mary, he lies to Ted, telling him that she's now an overweight mother confined to a wheelchair. Employing professional eavesdropping equipment, Pat gathers a dossier on Mary's life and future plans, information that forms the basis for more lies when Pat begins dating her. Sure enough, Mary falls for Pat, although her friend Tucker (Lee Evans) is very suspicious of Pat's claim to be a Harvard-educated architect. Meanwhile, Ted learns the truth but continues to encounter offbeat obstacles as he accelerates to Miami in hopes of finding happiness with his true love.

Every day, he and his friends Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman as not THAT Michael Bolton), suffer endless indignities and humiliations in their soulless workspace from their soulless boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). For Peter, stuck in his cookie-cutter apartment with paper-thin walls and IKEA furniture, every day is worse than the one before it -- so every day is the worst of his life. To cap it off, Initech has hired a pair of "efficiency experts" to downsize the company. One Friday night, Peter's soon to be ex-girlfriend Anne (Alexandra Wentworth) forces him to go to an occupational hypnotherapist to relieve work stress. While Peter is under hypnosis, the therapist keels over and dies. As he never snaps out of his hypnotic state, Peter has a new outlook on life. If something annoys him, he just ignores it or walks away from it. He is completely relaxed and enjoying life for the first time in a long time. On Monday, Peter skips work and sleeps in. He gets up for lunch and drives down to a restaurant next to his office and asks the waitress he's had a crush on, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), on a date. When Peter stops into the office to pick up his organizer, he's called in to talk to the efficiency experts. Relaxed and friendly, Peter charms them as he describes everything wrong with the office, including his boss. Even as Peter now appears at work only as the mood strikes him, the experts decide he's management material and give him a promotion even as they lay off the hardworking Samir and Michael. Peter then convinces his friends to exact revenge on Initech based upon an idea from Superman III. Not everything works out quite as planned.

    <title lang="en">To Sir, With Love II</title>
    <desc lang="en">Peter Bogdanovich directed this made-for-TV sequel to the well-remembered 1967 drama To Sir With Love. After 30 years as a teacher in a rough-and-tumble London school, Mark Thackeray (Sidney Poitier) finally retires and returns to America, settling into what he imagines will be a quiet life in Chicago. But Thackeray soon discovers that the nearby high school is not unlike the school he left behind in London -- run down, lacking discipline, and in dire need of teachers who genuinely care about their students. Thackeray decides to volunteer his services to the school, and soon finds himself teaching a history class to the toughest students he's ever had to face. Lulu and Judy Geeson, who starred as Poitier's students in the first film, make cameo appearances in To Sir With Love II, with Daniel J. Travanti and Jeff Sill highlighting the supporting cast of the sequel</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Final Season</title>
    <desc lang="en">A place where baseball is more than just a game fights to hold on to the national pastime in this drama inspired by a true story. Norway, IA, is a little town where folks take baseball seriously -- so much so that even though Norway's high school boasts less than a hundred students, their baseball team has brought home the state championship 19 times. Jim Van Scoyoc (Powers Boothe), Norway High's baseball coach, has received national attention for his skill with players, and when passionate baseball fan Kent Stock (Sean Astin) lands a teaching position nearby, he volunteers to work as an assistant for Van Scoyoc. While Stock cherishes his time with Van Scoyoc, he takes a job working in Saint Louis, where he plans to move with his fiancée. However, he changes his plans when he gets some unexpected news -- due to shrinking enrollment and budget cuts, Norway's high school is soon to close, and their upcoming baseball season is likely to be their last. Over the fierce objections of his girlfriend, Stock passes on the job in St. Louis to spend one last spring in Norway and help Van Scoyoc as he takes one last shot at taking his team to the state championship. Meanwhile, the citizens of Norway wage a legal battle to keep the school open, and the state sends a lawyer, Polly Hudson (Rachael Leigh Cook), to Norway to represent them. While Stock and Hudson are bitter enemies at the start of the season, with time she begins to understand the sense of tradition and love of the game that fuels Stock and the people of Norway. Also featuring Larry Miller, Tom Arnold, and Michael Angarano, The Final Season received its world premiere at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival</desc>

When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Millions</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Danny Boyle revisits a theme from his Shallow Grave and Trainspotting days -- greed -- but focuses on a much younger protagonist with this comedy drama. Millions opens with recent widower Ronnie (James Nesbitt) moving his two precocious pre-pubescent sons to the suburbs. Missing his mother and the comforts of his old neighborhood, the young Damian (Alex Etel) builds a cardboard-box fort on the outskirts of the suburb, where one day his placid introvert existence is literally crushed by a giant gym bag full of thousands of pounds' worth of cash. Less concerned with the origin of the money than with how to spend it, Damian and his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), decide to keep it a secret from their father, which becomes an increasingly tricky proposition as the days pass. His conscience getting in the way of his spending, Damian debates the ethics of his ill-gotten gains with a handful of imaginary saints, and begins to try to spend his cash a little more altruistically. But his charitable deeds inadvertently attract the attention of a mysterious, threatening man who's desperate to get his hands on the money. Marking a distinct change of pace for Boyle after the horror film 28 Days Later, Millions world-premiered at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tin Cup</title>
    <desc lang="en">Golfing drama about a washed-up old pro who tries to get back into the big time. Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy (Kevin Costner) ruined his career when he took a risk on the golf course which led to his disqualification from the game. Now he teaches golf to others at a driving range in Salome, Texas, with the help of his trusted friend Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin). But McAvoy's life starts to change when a new student walks into the training centre - Dr Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), who just happens to be dating PGA star David Simms (Don Johnson). To win Molly, 'Tin Cup' knows that he must impress her - and what better way than by beating Simms and winning the US Open? The problem, of course, is that 'Tin Cup' has been teaching golf for so long that he may have forgotten how to play!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Next Nostradamus</title>
    <desc lang="en">Many are overly familiar with the eerily prescient foretellings of 16th Century French prophet Michel de Nostradame, (1503-66). But few may realize that an early 21st century equivalent of Nostradamus began making prophecies comparable to those of the Middle Ages' most prominent seer - with the aid of a computer -in the late 1980s. Dr. Bueno de Mesquita's prophecies (unlike Nostradame's) were concrete enough that they actually enabled observers to predict events before those events occurred, including the second Intifada and the crackdown at Tianamen Square by the Chinese government. Then, de Mesquita emerged with a host of much darker and more foreboding prophecies including famine, World War III, and the arrival of the Antichrist. This documentary from The History Channel profiles de Mesquita and draws striking parallels between his work and that of Nostradamus, and raises key questions about what might lie ahead for humanity based on the conclusions of de Mesquita's work(n)</desc>
