    <desc lang="en">The Gum. When Kramer brings around his friend Lloyd, who's recently recovered after suffering a breakdown, it puts both Jerry and Elaine in awkward positions. First, Elaine loses a button on her shirt, exposing herself to Lloyd and giving him the wrong idea. Then, Jerry finds himself going with Lloyd to buy Chinese gum after Kramer suggests that turning the gum down might unsettle Lloyd. Meanwhile, a string of misunderstandings leads George's old neighbor to believe that he may be losing his grip and heading for a breakdown himself. Matt McCoy guest stars as Lloyd Braun a role previously played by Peter Keleghan in "The Non-Fat Yogurt." In addition, series creator Larry David makes a rare onscreen appearance in an uncredited role as a gum salesman. Originally airing December 14, 1995, "The Gum" was the tenth episode of the show's seventh season(r)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nixon. Part of the American Experience series on the presidents, this three-hour documentary examines the quest, triumph, fall, and legacy of one of America's most fascinating and controversial presidents. From his modest beginnings among the lemon groves in Yorba Linda, CA, to his taking on the highest position in the nation, the story of Richard Milhous Nixon is characterized by contradiction. A staunch anti-communist, Nixon opened up relations with China and the Soviet Union and took steps to end the conflict in Vietnam. American Experience describes how Nixon promoted family values and how he used his poker earnings to finance his first political campaign. From congressman to senator to vice president under Eisenhower, a man uncomfortable in his own skin, Nixon was nonetheless a tireless campaigner. The program details the "Pink Lady" campaign, the "Checkers" speech, and the humiliation of Watergate</desc>

Season Two of Grey's Anatomy picks up exactly where Season One left off, with the unexpected arrival at Seattle Grace Hospital of brilliant surgeon Addison Shepherd (Kate Walsh)--much to the dismay of Addison's estranged husband Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), to say nothing of Derek's current amour, surgical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Naturally, Meredith feels betrayed by Derek, and keeps on feeling that way throughout the rest of the episode. Meanwhile, chief of surgery Dr. Webber (James Pickens Jr.) recovers from his operation with the special help of intern George O'Malley (T.R. Knight), who has been appointed official bearer of gossip from the hospital; and Meredith's friend and coworker Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) has big news for her boss Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington)--and vice versa. Finally, arrogant intern Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) displays a hitherto untapped streak of compassion when the team's favorite bartender Joe suffers a heart attack</desc>

Back at Seattle Grace, Meredith's mom Ellis (Kate Burton), a brilliant surgeon struck down by Alzheimer's, is treated for diverticulitis--which unexpectedly becomes the catalyst for several revelations on the part of several secret lovers. Cristina resists the notion of telling Burke (Isaiah Washington) that she is pregnant, but this becomes a moot point when she collapses in the surgery room and Addison (Kate Walsh) is forced to perform an emergency operation. A young female patient (Angela Goethels) who suffers from uncontrollable blushing finds herself in the middle of a few interdepartmental intrigues. And George (T.R. Knight) is finally able to get the best of the insufferable Alex (Justin Chambers) when he is handed an unusally difficult assignment</desc>

But with success comes competition, and Untouchable J (Jay-Z) and Dame (Damon Dash), the leaders of an establish drug-dealing crew, decide the ABM are taking more than their share of the business, and begin retaliating with violence -- with both the ABM crew and Beans' wife as targets.

The two amateur sleuths decide to briefly bury the hatchet and solve the mystery...provided that Eudora can be trusted any farther than she can be thrown!</desc>

Smith plays government agent Jim West, who finds himself paired with fellow agent Artemus Gordon when Dr Arliss Loveless plots to assassinate the President. Both West and Gordon have their unique talents - Jim is a witty charmer who can talk his way out of any situation, while Artemus is a master of disguise with a dazzling talent for inventing things - and they'll need every trick in the book if they're to outwit their new nemesis. Look out for some spectacular special effects, including a giant transportation device known as The Tarantula, as well as Salma Hayek, who co-stars as the sassy love interest</desc>

A daring escape is quick to follow, and soon after washing up on mysterious shores the traumatized girl is sheltered by a benevolent old woman (Zohra Segal) who reveals to her the remarkable powers of common spices. Later, after moving to Oakland, California and opening her own spice shop, Tilo is compelled to follow three strict stipulations is she is to retain her ability to harness these magnificent powers: she must never use the powers for her own gain, she can never venture outside of her store, and she must never make contact with the skin of another person.

    <title lang="en">Dumb and Dumber To</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels reprise their roles as lovable imbeciles Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne in this sequel to Dumb and Dumber from original directing duo Bobby and Peter Farrelly. The movie revisits the titular duo of dumb Harry (Daniels) and dumber Lloyd (Carrey), 20 years after the events of the first film: Harry pays his first visit to his parents since the early '90s, and discovers a two-decade-old postcard from a gal he hooked up with (Kathleen Turner) informing him that she's pregnant. It turns out she had a daughter and put the girl up for adoption. Harry is moved by the prospect of having an adult child out there somewhere (and it just so happens that he needs a kidney transplant), so he and Lloyd embark on a road trip to track down his daughter. They get mixed up in many wacky situations along the way, like finding and stealing their old "Shaggin' Wagon," and being duped into pleasuring an old lady in exchange for her hearing aids</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dead Poets Society</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robin Williams toned down his usually manic comic approach in this successful period drama. In 1959, the Welton Academy is a staid but well-respected prep school where education is a pragmatic and rather dull affair. Several of the students, however, have their thoughts on the learning process (and life itself) changed when a new teacher comes to the school. John Keating (Williams) is an unconventional educator who tears chapters of his textbooks and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a new angle. Keating introduces his students to poetry, and his free-thinking attitude and the liberating philosophies of the authors he introduces to his class have a profound effect on his students, especially Todd (Ethan Hawke), who would like to be a writer; Neil ( Robert Sean Leonard), who dreams of being an actor, despite the objections of his father; Knox (Josh Charles), a hopeless romantic; Steven (Allelon Ruggiero), an intellectual who learns to use his heart as well as his head; Charlie (Gale Hansen), who begins to lose his blasé attitude; unconventional Gerard (James Waterston); and practical Richard (Dylan Kussman). Keating urges his students to seize the day and live their lives boldly; but when this philosophy leads to an unexpected tragedy, headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd) fires Keating, and his students leap to his defense. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Williams; it won one, for Tom Schulman's original screenplay</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Waking Ned Divine (1998) meets Up in Smoke (1978) in this wacky British comedy about growing marijuana. Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn is a cheerful upper-class housewife and gardening enthusiast who is blithefully unaware of business matters. This all changes when she learns that her husband fell from an airplane without a parachute. Her husband's numerous hare-brained schemes at getting rich quick left their accounts in utter ruin. Worse, if she does not raise 300,000 pounds quickly, she might lose her manor. Out of sheer desperation, she turns to her oddball Scottish gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson), who suggests growing pot. Grace puts her green thumb to work, and in the blink of an eye the greenhouse is converted into the biggest marijuana farm in Cornwall. Soon, word gets out to the not unsympathetic townspeople, including the local doctor -- who is somewhat of a pot enthusiast -- and a horror flick-loving Vicar. Unfortunately, a nervy French drug lord (Tcheky Karyo) also learns of their scheme and soon starts causing trouble</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the popular cartoon character, this family-oriented "ghost story" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl (Christina Ricci). The eternally irritable Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in New England. Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house</desc>

In the course of his investigation Doc butts heads with Lt. Det. Christian F. "Bigfoot" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), a part-time actor with a palpable distain for the free-love generation, and a reputation for committing civil-rights violations. Later, as clues to Wolfmann's disappearance begin to suggest a conspiracy involving the FBI and a mysterious underworld syndicate known as the Golden Fang, Doc seeks the help of his lawyer Sauncho Smilax, Esq. (Benicio Del Toro) and Deputy D.A. Penny Kimball (Reese Witherspoon). Meanwhile, Doc also agrees to search for Coy Harlingen (Owen Wilson), a reportedly deceased saxophone player who may not be as dead as rumors suggest, and who seems somehow tied to the ongoing Wolfmann investigation.

    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily</desc>

    <desc lang="en">1999 proved a banner year for screen portrayals of Satan's love life: first his relationship with Saddam Hussein went under the microscope in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, and a few months later his search for a girl to settle down with became the basis of this thriller. With the millennium approaching, a series of disturbing signs suggests that Satan (here played by Gabriel Byrne) has returned to Earth and is walking the streets of New York City. It seems that Satan needs to find a woman who will bear his child, as the time for the arrival of the anti-Christ draws near. A woman named Christine (Robin Tunney) believes that she has seen the Devil and felt his presence, and it's up to Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a former policeman turned elite bodyguard, to keep her safe from The Dark Lord. End of Days was both directed and photographed by Peter Hyams; Kevin Pollak, Renee Olstead, and Udo Kier are among the supporting cast</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hitler's Children</title>
    <desc lang="en">This modestly produced film version of Gregor Ziemmer's book Education for Death surprised everyone at RKO--and in the film industry--by becoming one the biggest hits of 1943. The "children" invoked in the title are borne on behalf of Adolf Hitler; according to the film, it is standard operating procedure in Nazi Germany for young girls to willingly submit to being impregnated by Aryan men (with or without the benefit of clergy) in order to sustain the "Master Race." Those who refuse are ticketed for sterilization, or worse. One of the holdouts is Bonita Granville, a German girl raised and educated in America whose taste of democracy has made her utterly resistant to Nazism. In the film's key scene, the near-naked Bonita is publicly flogged for her defiance, whereupon Bonita's lover, "good Nazi" Tim Holt, suddenly has an awakening of conscience and stops the whipping. This act of courage results in the executions of both Holt and Granville, but they willingly go to their deaths rather than accede to Hitler's demands. It is true enough that many people flocked to see Hitler's Children because of the sensational, censor-provoking aspects of the film, but equal numbers of filmgoers and critics also recognized the above-average artistic contributions of director Edward Dmytryk and scriptwriter Emmet Lavery (both of whom received substantial cash bonuses for their work on this film). Hitler's Children was the second biggest moneymaker of RKO's 1943-44 season, only slightly behind the Cary Grant vehicle Mr. Lucky</desc>

    <title lang="en">H.M. Pulham, Esq.</title>
    <desc lang="en">MGM was doing so well in 1941 that it could afford the occasional "prestige" film with little box-office appeal. Based on the novel by J.P. Marquand, H.M. Pulham, Esq., stars Robert Young as a successful but stuffy Boston businessman. The glimmer of sadness in Young's eyes indicates that his ascension to the top was not without its cost. In flashbacks, we see how Young considered changing the track his life was on in order to marry Hedy Lamarr. After marrying his wife, however, the man never strays. The film utilizes the Strange Interlude approach of interior monologues heard on the soundtrack, and anticipates Citizen Kane (which hadn't yet been released when Pulham was filmed) by building its entire narrative on the flashback structure. H.M. Pulham, Esq. contains what may well be Robert Young's best performance, though few filmgoers in 1941 were interested enough to see it</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The once-notorious theatrical chestnut White Cargo was toned down for public consumption in this 1942 MGM-ized adaptation (the property had been previously filmed in England in 1929). More sullen than sexy, Hedy Lamarr stars as Tondelayo, the libidinous African native girl who nearly drives rubber-plantation manager Langford (Richard Carlson) to ruin and madness. Though warned by local English magistrate Witzel (Walter Pidgeon) not to "mammy-palaver" with the natives, Langford falls hopelessly in love with Tondelayo, marrying her in defiance of convention and anti-miscegenation laws. Alas, the restless Tondelayo soons tires of married life, just as Langford wearies of his bride's near-manic possessiveness. She tries to come on to Witzel, who'll have none of it, then plots to rid herself of her husband by systematically poisoning him during a bout of fever. A studio-imposed prologue and epilogue set in the 1940s was inserted to assure the audiences from the outset that Langford would eventually wise up and divest himself of the troublesome Tondelayo. Though corny and campy in the extreme, White Cargo is one of the films for which Hedy Lamarr is best remembered</desc>

Graduating senior Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin) has plans to attend a prestigious writing workshop in London, despite the protests of his widowed mother (Marcia Gay Harden). In the days before his departure, he gets into a cafeteria brawl with a delinquent classmate, Annie Newton (Margarita Levieva), while defending his friend from her extortion attempts. Annie and her crew track Nick down on the night he's planning to leave, mistakenly thinking he ratted her out to the police regarding a smash-and-grab burglary committed the night before. When the subsequent beating goes too far, the assailants dump the body in the woods in a panicked attempt to dispose of it. Only, Nick isn't dead -- he's walking invisible among his classmates, friends, and family, desperately trying to alert them that he's still alive. Robbed of the traditional forms of communication, Nick must figure out supernatural methods of manipulating his environment -- and he soon realizes the very girl who attacked him may be the only one who has the power to save him</desc>

As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two carefree Americans embark on an overseas vacation that soon becomes a nightmare in this powerful drama. Alice (Claire Danes) is a headstrong teenager who wants to do something different to celebrate her high school graduation, so she persuades her more reserved best friend Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) to join her on a trip to Bangkok. While enjoying sun and scenery, Alice and Darlene meet Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), a charming Australian who shows them the sights and sweet-talks Darlene into a romantic assignation, which is something of a surprise to her bolder friend Alice. Nick then suggests that they join him on a side trip to Hong Kong, but they soon discover that Nick's interest has been neither friendly nor romantic: he has hidden a large amount of heroin in their luggage and is using them as drug runners without their knowledge. When the heroin is found by customs officials, Alice and Darlene are quickly tried and sentenced to 33 years in a hideous prison known to inmates as Broke-Down Palace. Their plight comes to the attention of "Yankee Hank" (Bill Pullman), a renegade American attorney in Asia, but while Hank struggles with the court system to get Alice and Darlene released, they must deal with the living hell of life behind bars, and their own doubts about each other. Brokedown Palace was directed by Jonathan Kaplan, who previously dealt with judicial injustice in The Accused and teens in difficult circumstances in Over the Edge</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Are you ready for a new kind of superhero -- a thirty-something virgin in long underwear? Darryl Walker (Damon Wayans) is a bright but socially inept man with a gift for inventing things but little skill for functioning in the real world. His brother Kevin (David Alan Grier) works on a low-class tabloid news show featuring beautiful anchorwoman Kimberley Jonz (Robin Givens), whom he secretly loves. The Walkers live in Metro City, Illinois, a city that's been hit with a massive crime wave after the mayor is kidnapped by gangsters. After his grandmother is killed, Darryl builds a collection of crime-fighting robots from household junk, invents bullet-proof long underwear (made from his grandmother's old housecoat), and becomes Metro City's newest crime fighter, Blankman. Blankman's escapades put fear into the heart of mob boss Michael Minelli (Jon Polito), and when Kevin turns out to have an inside track on Blankman's activities, it brings him closer to Kimberley. But how long can a superhero with no superpowers last against the forces of organized crime? Damon Wayans wrote the original story for Blankman as well as co-writing the screenplay and playing the title role, which was based in part on his "Handi-Man" character from the TV comedy series In Living Color</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nicole Beharie, Tim Blake Nelson, Will Patton, and Xzibit headline this fact-based drama about an innocent Texas mother caught up in a high-profile drug raid, and unjustly accused due to the uncorroborated testimony of a single informant. Dee Roberts (Beharie) is a young single mother of four living in a small Texas town. Arrested during a drug raid and accused of a crime she didn't commit, Dee goes against the wishes of her mother, Alma (Alfre Woodard), and rejects the plea-bargain that would free her from jail, but brand her as a felon for life. As word begins to spread that similar incidents are occurring in poor communities all across the country, Dee realizes that there are more mothers out there like her, and decides to take a stand against powerful district attorney Calvin Beckett (Michael O'Keefe). Now, despite being well aware of District Attorney Beckett's fierce reputation, Dee enlists the aid of ACLU attorney David Cohen (Nelson) and former narcotics officer Sam Conroy (Patton) in overcoming the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that, if not navigated with the greatest of caution, now threaten to destroy her life. With the custody of her children on the line, one brave mother wages a valiant battle to strike at the very heart of the corrupt Texas justice system(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Edward Scissorhands</title>
    <desc lang="en">Like most of Tim Burton's films, Edward Scissorhands doesn't offer much of a middle ground: You'll either adore it or ignore it. The film opens as eccentric inventor Vincent Price lovingly assembles a synthetic youth named Edward (Johnny Depp). The boy has all the essential ingredients except a pair of hands; he has temporarily been fitted out with pointy, shardlike metal extremities. Alas, the inventor dies before Edward can be completed. Left alone in the huge Price mansion, Edward is rescued by Avon lady Peg Boggs (Dianne Weist), who adopts the boy despite his scissorlike hands. Though his gestures have the capacity to maim or even kill, Edward is a gentle soul who wants only to be loved. Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Rider) likes Edward, but can't adjust to his clawlike hands and retreats to a tempestuous relationship with bully-boy Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). Becoming a local celebrity, Edward is surrounded by fair-weather friends. When he's accused of a crime, however, only Peg and Kim champion his cause. As bizarre as the proceeding becomes at times, Edward Scissorhands maintains its essential heart and warmth, thanks to a magnificent performance by Johnny Depp. Be prepared, however, for the most poignant finale this side of Chaplin's City Lights</desc>

    <desc lang="en">9.79*. As directed by Daniel Gordon, this documentary revisits the explosive controversy that erupted at the height of the 24th Olympic Games, which took place in Seoul, South Korea from September through October 1988. Spectators of the original event will recall that two formidable athletes - American Carl Lewis and Canadian Ben Johnson - went head to head in the men's 100-meter dash; at the time, Lewis was still riding on the crest of his celebrity stature as a 1984 L.A. Olympics contender, and many regarded Johnson as the ultimate underdog, rebounding as he was from a pulled hamstring. Johnson won the hearts of Canadians everywhere and became a national hero by edging Lewis out during the event, in a spectacular time of 9.79 seconds. But within merely a few days, the Olympic committee shocked everyone by disqualifying Johnson on the basis of a failed drug y one test. In the immediate wake of this development, he lost his medal to Lewis. In this film, director Gordon opens up a mystery surrounding that changed decision: was Johnson, he asks, unique in using steroids, or merely the fall guy for a broad practice that involved multiple team members at the time, given the fact that six of Johnson's teammates were eventually indicted for the same reason? Gordon climbs inside of the controversy via interviews with Johnson, Lewis, teammates and Olympic insiders; in the process, he uncovers multiple layers of truth in this strange, disturbing situation that still invites discussion and inquiry, decades later(n)</desc>

A quick recap apprises the viewer that, while investigating a curious archeological discovery, Lt. Cmdr. Data was sucked into a time vortex, emerging in 19th century San Francisco. Likewise heading into the past to rescue their comrade, the crew discovers that the Earth is in danger of a devastating alien invasion. Their efforts to ward off this disaster are complicated by the presence of a snoopy reporter by the name of Samuel Clemens (Jerry Hardin). Part two of "Time's Arrow" was scripted by Jeri Taylor, from a story by Joe Menosky and Michael Piller</desc>
