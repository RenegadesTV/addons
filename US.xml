Much as she loathes the prospect of being surrounded by "geeks and dweebs," Kelly rises to the occasion with an astonishingly uninhibited dance interpretation of the pop song "Fever." A young Jesse Borego (24) appears in this episode, wherein we are treated for the first time to the Bundy Family Credo: "When One Bundy Is Embarrassed, the Rest of Us Feel Better About Ourselves."(n)</desc>

Swapping identities to get their parents reconciled, this charming family film never descends into schmaltz, thanks in part to the supporting roles of Elaine Hendrix as the gold digger after Nick's money and Simon Kunz as Elizabeth's acidly droll butler(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">No Time like the Past</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">No Time like the Past. Disillusioned with the present, Paul Driscoll (Dana Andrews) builds a time machine and heads to the past, hoping to correct mankind's mistakes. Failing spectacularly in this endeavor, he elects to take up permanent residence in the small town of Homeville, Indiana, circa 1881, where he hopes to live out his life in quiet contentment. Alas, despite his herculean efforts not to alter the course of history, that is just what he ends up doing. As originally written by Rod Serling, this hour-long Twilight Zone episode opened with a lengthy philosophical discussion between Driscoll and his mentor Dr. Harvey. This was adjudged too dull for TV consumption, thus a new opening was dreamed up wherein Driscoll was shown trying to prevent the sinking of the Lusitania and the rise of Hitler's Nazi Party. Accordingly, the role of Dr. Harvey was diminished, obliging proposed costar Joseph Schildkraut to drop out of the episode. The final version of "No Time Like the Past" premiered March 7, 1963(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Curse of the Jade Scorpion</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Woody Allen returns to the Manhattan of the past with this romantic comedy set in 1940, the era of fedora hats and gumshoe detectives. Allen stars as C.W. Briggs, an insurance investigator whose razor-sharp instincts have just led to the successful conclusion of another case, the recovery of a stolen Picasso. While he's a valued employee, Briggs is under fire from efficiency expert Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) for his antiquated attitudes and refusal to accept modern crime-solving techniques such as fingerprinting. C.W. claims he puts himself directly into the criminal mind, a skill that will do him no good when he and Betty Ann are hypnotized at a Rainbow Room gathering one night by the magician Volton (David Ogden Stiers). As a parlor trick to entertain their co-workers, Volton makes C.W. and Betty Ann believe they're a couple that's deeply in love. But the performer secretly keeps up the ruse after the party's over, calling C.W. to whisper a magic code word and ordering the detective to rob wealthy homes with security systems that C.W. himself has designed. With no memory of his thieving activities, a frustrated C.W. can't solve the high-profile jewel burglaries, while he and Betty Ann struggle with their odd new attraction for each other, made more complicated by the fact that Betty Ann is romantically involved with their boss (Dan Aykroyd)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Blue</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop's personal code of justice begins to change after a number of incidents lead his city to a tragic wave of violence in this police drama. Eldon Perry (Kurt Russell) is a veteran cop with the LAPD's Special Investigations unit, a man who isn't above bending the law if it means putting people behind bars who deserve the treatment. As Los Angeles waits on the verdict in the Rodney King police beating trial, Perry is presenting testimony to Assistant Chief of Police Arthur Holland (Ving Rhames), who is well aware of the corruption in the SIS unit and wants to stop it. Perry, however, twists some facts as he speaks in the defense of his new partner, Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman), who is being investigated for inappropriate use of deadly force. For lack of honest testimony, Keough is let off the hook, and soon he and Perry have a new case to investigate -- a robbery at a liquor store than turned into a quadruple homicide. Perry and Keough quickly track down two likely suspects, Orchard (Kurupt) and Sidwell (Dash Mihok), but Perry is surprised when the head of SIS, Van Meter (Brendan Gleeson), tells him to let Orchard and Sidwell go, and instead points the finger at two ex-cons who should be taken off the street, even though they're innocent of this crime. Perry follows Van Meter's orders, despite Keough's misgivings, but in the wake of the L.A. riots, Perry has a change of heart, and decides to start working with Holland against Van Meter's corrupt methods. In the midst of it all, Perry is trying to hold together his troubled marriage to Sally (Lolita Davidovich), while Keough finds himself romancing a fellow officer, Beth (Michael Michele). Dark Blue was adapted from an original screenplay by noted crime novelist James Ellroy; originally set against the backdrop of the 1965 Watts riots, the story was later updated to 1992(n)</desc>

Dr. Ellison tells Joe that he has something called "a brain cloud" that is rapidly spreading throughout his brain. He will feel great, but he'll be dead within five months. Instead of being depressed at this bleak prognosis, Joe suddenly feels free. He quits his job, asks DeDe out, and is contacted by a rich millionaire named Graynamore (Lloyd Bridges). Graynamore owns an island named Waponi Woo, whose natives need to be placated. The natives require a sacrifice to their island volcano, the Big Woo, so that the island won't sink beneath the Pacific. Graynamore offers unlimited wealth to Tom in exchange for Tom's becoming the object of human sacrifice. Joe has nothing to lose, so he accepts the offer. As he heads out to the island, Joe meets Graynamore's daughters -- Angelica, a Los Angeles socialite, and Patricia, Angelica's blonde half-sister (both roles played by Ryan). Joe arrives at the island, and as he stands at the lips of the Big Woo he has to decide whether he really wants to leap into the maw of the fiery volcano(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hell Below transcends its hackneyed World War I plot to emerge as a drama of rare originality and gutsiness. Walter Huston stars as a submarine commander whose lieutenant (Robert Montgomery) falls in love with Huston's daughter (Madge Evans). All cliches (including the intrusive comedy relief of Jimmy Durante) are forgiven and forgotten once the sub is launched on a dangerous mission in the Adriatic. Commander Huston is forced to make several cold-blooded decisions to preserve the safety of his crew members. In one scene, seaman Sterling Holloway is trapped in a room full of poison gas. Huston orders the men not to rescue Holloway, lest they too be exposed to the deadly fumes. As the men grimly try to go about their routine tasks, the dying Holloway presses his face against the glassed-in porthole and piteously begs for help! This brief moment in Hell Below sticks in the mind far longer than Robert Montgomery's own death scene, in which he redeems his reckless behavior during a crucial battle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Nuisance</title>
    <desc lang="en">J. Phineas Stevens (Lee Tracy) is a personal injury lawyer whose practice has become a nightmare to any number of defendants, most notably the local streetcar company that handles transportation for his city. Between his steel-trap brain and machine-gun style delivery in court, and the machinations of his friend and expert witness Dr. Prescott (Frank Morgan), they've cost the company tens of thousands of dollars, with no end in sight. The corporation's lead counsel, Calhoun (John Miljan), decides to fight Stevens with his own tactics, setting him up by planting investigator Dorothy Mason (Madge Evans) in his midst, as a supposed injury victim. She's successful at beguiling Stevens, and gets enough on him to accidentally bring about the death of the one man he trusts -- and then she finds out that he's not solely the grasping mercenary that she thought he was; that he has an admirable side, as well; and that if he's gotten too good at gouging his opponents in court, it's partly the fault of Calhoun. Her second thoughts about her assignment set off a courtroom doneybrook, getting Stevens off the hook and Dorothy tossed into jail. And that sets Stevens after the streetcar company and Calhoun with a vengeance, and this time it's personal. With his best men, including inveterate conman "Floppy Phil" (Charles Butterworth), working for a cause and not just cash, it looks like Armageddon for the streetcar company and Calhoun, who won't budge an inch(n)</desc>

In the year 859 A.D., as the Tang dynasty is beset by rebellion, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) are a pair of lawmen who have been given the task of ferreting out the leaders of a revolutionary faction known as the Flying Daggers. Working on a tip that members of the group are working out of a brothel called the Peony Pavilion, Jin arrives there in disguise and is introduced to a beautiful blind dancer named Mei (Zhang Ziyi). After watching Mei's performance following several drinks, Jin drunkenly attempts to have his way with her, and Leo is forced to intervene. After gaining Mei's trust in a game of skill, Leo arrests her and informs her that she'll be tortured if she doesn't tell all she knows about the Flying Daggers. Jin responds by helping Mei break out of prison, but he has an ulterior motive -- by following her, Leo and Jin are certain she'll lead them to the Flying Daggers. However, as he helps the blind girl find her way back home, Jin finds himself falling in love with Mei, and isn't certain if he's willing to betray her again(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bill Duke directs this quirky film adaptation of Chester Himes' crime novel -- a heavily plotted gangster tale with a sweet love story hidden underneath. The film begins in Natchez, Mississippi in 1956. During a police shoot-out with the mob leader Slim's (Badja Djola) gang, Slim's moll Imabelle (Robin Givens) takes off with a cadre of stolen gold. As a result, Imabelle is chased by Slim's mob from Mississippi to New York. By the time she reaches Harlem, she is broke and has to figure out a way to ditch the trunk full of gold. She finds herself at the annual Undertaker's Ball, where she sees the big and dumb Jackson (Forest Whitaker), a bumbling undertaker's assistant. She spots Jackson as a mark that she can use as a cover and latches onto him immediately. She moves in with him to hide out, but Imabelle becomes taken with his innocence. For his part, Jackson falls head over heels in love with her. But the Mississippi mob catches up with her and takes her away. Jackson calls in his street-wise brother Goldy (Gregory Hines) to help him rescue Imabelle. Jackson fears that Imabelle has been kidnapped. But Goldy knows better -- he still agrees to help him but Goldy wants the gold for himself(n)</desc>

But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A visually arresting, dark family fantasy - part live action, part CGI - from long-time graphic novel collaborators Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean (The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch; The Sandman), here working as screenwriter and director respectively. The story centres on Helen (Stephanie Leonidas), who's fed up with life at her parents' circus and desperately wants to get away. But one day she loses her temper and wishes her mother dead - and is mortified to see her cruel wish seemingly begin to come true. She realises that she'd do anything to retract her 'curse', but instead finds herself thrown suddenly into a surreal landscape that's by turns beautiful, sinister and scary. It is a realm ruled by the Queen of Shadows and the Queen of Light, who once balanced each other out - to the benefit of their subjects. But now the Queen of Shadows is in the ascendant, and only Helen can restore the land's much-needed equilibrium by seeking out the immensely powerful MirrorMask, which is also her only way out of this strange and troubling new world(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On the Record With Greta Van Susteren</title>
    <desc lang="en">As part of the ongoing ratings war between rival cable services CNN and The Fox News Network, CNN commentator Greta Van Susteren was wooed to the "other network" with promises of a much larger salary and a nightly interview program of her own. That program, On the Record With Greta Van Susteren, debuted on February 4, 2002. While some observers were mildly surprised that Van Susteren, whose politics tended to be left of center, would agree to star on a cable network with a perceived Conservative slant, most of the press attention concerning the new series was focused on Van Susteren's remarkable cosmetic-surgery makeover, which she insisted had been decided upon long before Fox News Network offered her a job. On the Record With Greta Van Susteren was seen on a Monday through Friday basis from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. EST(n)</desc>
