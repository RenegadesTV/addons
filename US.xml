    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser.

    <title lang="en">Pearl Harbor</title>
    <desc lang="en">At the time of its release, this lavish period war drama from hyperkinetic director Michael Bay became the most expensive motion picture ever green-lighted by a studio. Ben Affleck stars as Rafe McCawley, a military pilot stationed under Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) in New Jersey, along with his best friend from childhood, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). Rafe is chomping at the bit to get involved in World War II, but America has not entered the conflict, so he is forced to fight on loan to the Royal Air Force in Britain, leaving behind his beautiful girlfriend Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). After Rafe goes overseas, both Danny and Evelyn are transferred to the naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where word arrives that Rafe has been killed in action. A grief-stricken Evelyn and Danny become romantically attached, a situation that becomes a lit powder keg when Rafe suddenly reappears, having survived his ordeal in the European war. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor puts the romantic triangle on hold, as the best friends are ordered to undertake a top-secret and highly dangerous retaliatory mission to bomb Tokyo, once again under the command of Doolittle. Although the trio of leads are entirely fictional, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore, and Jon Voight (as FDR) co-star in the roles of real-life historical figures. Pearl Harbor is based on a script by Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart (1995) and The Man in the Iron Mask (1998). Taking a page from the production history of James Cameron's Titanic (1997), many of the actors and filmmakers involved with Pearl Harbor deferred their usual salaries until the film "broke even" at the box office</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Happy Birthday, Babies - Part 1. The 5th birthday of Michelle Tanner (played by the Olsen twins) sparks a retrospective of the family's previous adventures, conveyed via excerpts from the series' first four seasons. But Michelle is in anything but a festive mood: with Becky about to give birth to twins any day now, the youngest member of the Tanner household is worried that she'll soon be upstaged by her new cousins. This is the first episode of a two-part story(n)</desc>

And if this wasn't enough chaos, Becky's husband Jesse (John Stamos) turns out to need emergency surgery of a different sort--and as result, when the twins are born, Becky is wide awake and Jesse is fast asleep. This episode marks the first appearance of Nicky and Alex Katsopolis, the newest members of the Tanner household(n)</desc>

When Danny (Bob Saget) is elected San Francisco's "Bachelor of the Month", daughter Michelle (played by the Olsen twins) worries that her dad will be spending so much time socializing that he won't have any room for her. Elsewhere, the pressures of parenthood are already taking quite a toll on Jesse (John Stamos) and Becky (Lisa Loughlin). And Becky's temporary "Wake Up San Francisco" replacement Vicky Larson (Gail Edwards) proves to be a bit too outspoken for her own good--but Danny is fascinated by her all the same(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Jamie Foxx Show</title>
    <desc lang="en">Former In Living Color regular and future Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx was the eponymous star of this long-running sitcom, one of the most popular and successful efforts of the fledgling WB network. The series' semi-autobiographical through line found Foxx cast as an aspiring actor named Jamie King, who in the first season traveled from his native Texas to Los Angeles, hoping to achieve stardom. To save money, Jamie accepted an invitation to live rent-free at King's Tower, a once-prominent but now rundown hotel managed by his chronic-gambler Uncle Junior (Garrett Morris) and his no-nonsense Aunt Helen (Ellia English). In exchange for his room, Jamie was expected to do a variety of odd jobs around the hotel, which brought him into contact with sexy front-desk clerk Francesca "Fancy" Monroe (Garcelle Beauvais), persnickety hotel accountant Braxton P. Hartnabrig (Christopher P. Duncan), and during the initial ten episodes, klutzy bellhop Dennis (Andy Berman). In the course of the series, Jamie and Fancy fell in love, though their romance ran a dizzying gamut of spectacular heights and doleful depths, with numerous breakups, reconciliations, and "outside" affairs for both parties. After a particularly devastating career setback (he had been hired and fired as an opening act for the rap group K-Ci &amp; JoJo), Jamie went to work for Jingles 2000 an ad agency which shipped out commercial jingles at the outset of season four. Here he met a whole new complement of series regulars, including his boss Bob (Blake Clark) and fellow employees Phil (Alex Thomas), Mouse (Suli McCullough), Curtis (Curtis Spencer), and Nicole (Rhona Bennett). Though he'd eventually be sacked at Jingles 2000, he managed to launch a nightclub singing act with Nicole, a professional relationship that became intensely personal by the end of the season. Ultimately choosing Fancy over Nicole, Jamie developed a solo singing act, but at series' end, he had agreed to assume control of King's Tower -- and to finally marry Fancy. Debuting August 28, 1996, The Jamie Foxx Show remained a WB fixture until September 23, 2001(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Jamie Foxx Show</title>
    <desc lang="en">Former In Living Color regular and future Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx was the eponymous star of this long-running sitcom, one of the most popular and successful efforts of the fledgling WB network. The series' semi-autobiographical through line found Foxx cast as an aspiring actor named Jamie King, who in the first season traveled from his native Texas to Los Angeles, hoping to achieve stardom. To save money, Jamie accepted an invitation to live rent-free at King's Tower, a once-prominent but now rundown hotel managed by his chronic-gambler Uncle Junior (Garrett Morris) and his no-nonsense Aunt Helen (Ellia English). In exchange for his room, Jamie was expected to do a variety of odd jobs around the hotel, which brought him into contact with sexy front-desk clerk Francesca "Fancy" Monroe (Garcelle Beauvais), persnickety hotel accountant Braxton P. Hartnabrig (Christopher P. Duncan), and during the initial ten episodes, klutzy bellhop Dennis (Andy Berman). In the course of the series, Jamie and Fancy fell in love, though their romance ran a dizzying gamut of spectacular heights and doleful depths, with numerous breakups, reconciliations, and "outside" affairs for both parties. After a particularly devastating career setback (he had been hired and fired as an opening act for the rap group K-Ci &amp; JoJo), Jamie went to work for Jingles 2000 an ad agency which shipped out commercial jingles at the outset of season four. Here he met a whole new complement of series regulars, including his boss Bob (Blake Clark) and fellow employees Phil (Alex Thomas), Mouse (Suli McCullough), Curtis (Curtis Spencer), and Nicole (Rhona Bennett). Though he'd eventually be sacked at Jingles 2000, he managed to launch a nightclub singing act with Nicole, a professional relationship that became intensely personal by the end of the season. Ultimately choosing Fancy over Nicole, Jamie developed a solo singing act, but at series' end, he had agreed to assume control of King's Tower -- and to finally marry Fancy. Debuting August 28, 1996, The Jamie Foxx Show remained a WB fixture until September 23, 2001(n)</desc>

In the first part of Charmed's sixth-season opener (originally telecast as a single two-hour episode), the Charmed Ones -- namely Piper (Holly Marie Combs), Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), and Paige (Rose McGowan) -- have no idea why their Whitelighter (guardian angel) Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) -- who also happens to be the father of Piper's son, Wyatt -- has been plucked from their midst. Only novice Whitelighter Chris (Drew Fuller), who has been assigned to protect little Wyatt, seems to have the full story about Leo's disappearance -- and he's not telling. The complications begin to multiply when Piper is accidentally rendered amnesiac, Phoebe suddenly develops the powers of an empath (making her oversensitive to the pains of others), and Paige spearheads a desperate search for Leo(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Invaders</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Invaders. Written by Richard Matheson, this is one of those classic Twilight Zone episodes that has remained in the collective memory long after other lesser episodes (and lesser anthologies) have been forgotten. The action takes place at a remote farmhouse, where a soil-stained farm woman (Agnes Moorehead) is forced to defend herself from a tiny spaceship and its equally diminutive occupants. Except for the final scene, the episode is entirely bereft of dialogue, affording Moorehead the opportunity to deliver a bravura pantomime performance. Originally telecast January 27, 1961, "The Invaders" was selected as the final Twilight Zone rerun of the 1961-62 season -- which at the time was assumed to be the series' very last installment</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a diverse group of lifelong friends comes together to celebrate the marriage of devoted couple Elise (Amy Adams) and Michael (Adam Garcia), the mixed-up relationships of the past pave the road to a weekend no one is likely to soon forget in the feature debut from filmmaker Matthew Cole Weiss. The setting is Los Angeles, CA, and the event is the wedding between a man and a woman who always seemed destined to be together. Unfortunately, all relationships can't be as healthy as Elise and Michael's is, and though best man and maid of honor Rich (Aaron Stanford) and Samantha (Melissa Sagemiller) seem to be preparing to take the plunge, the same certainly cannot be said for neurotic actress Lana (Mena Suvari). A free-spirited soul who has experienced flings with a variety of wedding attendees including the hapless Pockets (Jon Abrahams), alcoholic actor Simon (James Van Der Beek), and manic children's television program host Donovan (Ethan Embry), Lana attempts to sort out her past flings as lovelorn agent Quentin (Colin Hanks) pines for the bride's sister and the estranged father of the groom attempts to reconnect with his long-lost son</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Glenn Plummer delivers a powerful performance in this angry film based on Crips, a novel written by South Central Los Angeles high school teacher Donald Baker, and directed by Steve Anderson, who served time in prison. Plummer plays Bobby, a young black man trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of hatred, incarceration, and bloodshed. On his first day out of prison, he comes back to the streets of South Central LA and the only family he knows --the gang. He finds that his best friend Ray-Ray (Byron Keith Minns) is now the leader of the Deuces. Ray-Ray, with plenty of sweet talk, easily talks Bobby into committing a murder, killing a rival gang leader. But before the killing Bobby finds that his girlfriend Carole (LaRita Shelby) has given birth to his son. He also sees that she is becoming too dependent on her drug supply. After the killing, Bobby is hauled back into jail for a ten-year stretch. In jail, Bobby undergoes a transformation. Introduced to the Muslim community and mentored by an older convict named Ali (Carl Lumbly), Bobby begins to read W.E.B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King. He learns about self-respect and how gangs use people like him. When he is once again released from prison, Bobby is a new man. But South Central has gone from bad to worse. Carole, now completely addicted to cocaine, works as a hooker to support her habit. He also discovers that Ray-Ray has recruited his 10-year-old son Jimmie (Christian Coleman) as a junior gang member, stealing car stereos. Jimmie looks upon Ray-Ray as a role model and Bobbie must find a way to save his child from the violent and doomed future of a gang member</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this first sequel to 1989's Batman, the Caped Crusader (Michael Keaton) is up against the Penguin (Danny DeVito), the hideously deformed scion of a wealthy Gotham City family. The Penguin plots with evil businessman Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) to become mayor and then turn Gotham into a cathedral of crime. Upon overhearing these plans, Schreck's mousy secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is tossed from a high-rise window by her boss. Rescued by a covey of kittens, Selena transforms into the leather-clad Catwoman. In this guise, she teams with the Penguin and Schreck to divvy up their ill-gotten gains and help discredit Batman-but she also has her own scores to settle. Paul "Pee-Wee Herman" Reubens, Vincent Schiavelli and Jan Hooks play significant bits, while Pat Hingle and Michael Gough make returns as, respectively, Commissioner Gordon and Alfred the Butler</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The wind whispers ominous warnings of death before a malevolent entity arrives to claim the life of a young girl as director Courtney Solomon brings author Brent Monahan's chilling, fact-based story of supernatural murder to the screen in this tale of terror starring Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek. The year is 1818 and the Bell family is a quiet clan residing on a remote farm in Red River, TN. A normal, loving family by all accounts, the uneventful lives of the Bell family begin to take a dark turn when strange noises around the farm are followed by the arrival of a black wolf with piercing yellow eyes said to strike unspeakable fear into the very soul of all who encounter it. As the sadistic spirit singles out the youngest daughter of the Bell family for torment and her frightened parents search frantically for a rational explanation to the chilling events unfolding in their once-happy home, an eerie, disembodied voice promises death from beyond the grave. With the struggle rapidly turning violent and the Bells' desperate prayers for mercy going unanswered time and again, the shocking murder that followed would prove the only case in recorded American history where the death of a human being was directly attributed to an attack by an evil entity or spirit</desc>

As this bizarre revelation sinks in, Cleveland becomes enraptured by her other-worldly charm. As he shelters her in his apartment, other inhabitants of the building begin falling into place as representations of characters from an Eastern myth in which these mermaids, or "narfs," co-exist unhappily with more beastly and violent characters. In human reality, the forces of darkness that threaten the heroes of a fairy tale prove to be much more terrifying, and the victory of good over evil is by no means guaranteed. Jeffery Wright, Jared Harris and Mary Beth Hurt co-star, as well as Shyamalan himself, playing the visionary writer Vick</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Joel and Ethan Coen's third collaboration, the gangster film Miller's Crossing, stars Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan, the right-hand man of big-city Irish mob boss Leo (Albert Finney). The film opens with Italian mobster Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) and his second in command Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman) informing Leo and Tom that they are going to kill bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) because he has been revealing Caspar's fixed fights to other gamblers. Leo informs Caspar that Bernie pays for protection and is not to be touched. After the Italians leave in a huff, Tom informs Leo that he should give up Bernie. Tom and Leo are both involved with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), Bernie's sister. After a failed hit on Leo starts a full-scale mob war, Tom reveals to Leo the truth about his relationship with Verna. This leads to a falling-out between the pair. Tom goes to work for Caspar, but in truth, he is still loyal to Leo. Tom figures out how to manipulate all of the situations so that Leo survives, but this may cost Tom his relationship with Verna(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Anthony Hopkins, Ryan Gosling and David Strathairn star in Gregory Hoblit's twist-filled legal drama. When top airplane engineer Ted Crawford discovers that his wife has been cheating on him he takes a devastatingly direct route to revenge: he drives home and shoots his errant spouse in the face. He then waits for the police to turn up and confesses to the crime. With his wife in a coma, Crawford is arrested and enters the justice system. It should, of course, be the simplest prosecution ever. And lawyer Willy Beachum can be forgiven for thinking that his last case as a criminal attorney (before he switches to company law) is set to be a doddle. However, once the case comes to court, Crawford, representing himself, proceeds to tear apart the ample evidence that's stacked against him. Can he possibly get away with his crime? Also starring Rosamund Pike, Billy Burke and Fiona Shaw(n)</desc>

But he discovers his new property is slightly unusual: he now owns a team of sled dogs. It turns out his mother was an Alaskan sled-racing champion! Another shock awaits Ted in the frozen wastes: his real dad is a grumpy old white man who's only interested in Ted's dogs. The fun comes as thick and fast as a blizzard when Ted decides to gain his dad's respect by defending his mother's title. The only trouble is, he's never raced sled dogs in his life... Two Oscar winners come together in this hilarious movie, as Cuba Gooding Jr plays the dentist who spends a lot of his time up to his waist in snow, while James Coburn is his father, who's out to get his son's inheritance. Laughter comes in flurries as Gooding proves how cool he is, in a very different way from his normal roles!(n)</desc>

When their boss is kidnapped, however, Sean and Dee Loc must work together to save their employer, their jobs, and their friendship.

    <desc lang="en">This throwback to the frolicsome comedies of the 1970s is from writer/director D.J. Pooh, creator of Friday (1995) and 3 Strikes (2000). Dr. Dre stars as Sean, who's financially strapped and on the verge of losing his home and his car until his roommate Dee Loc Snoop Dogg suggests he join him as an employee at the local car wash. Tensions mount between the pals when the establishment's eccentric owner Mr. Washington (George Wallace) promotes the more mature and responsible Sean over Dee Loc, and Sean is subsequently forced to crack down on his scamming buddy's side hustles and locker room assignations with female co-workers. When their boss is kidnapped, however, Sean and Dee Loc must work together to save their employer, their jobs, and their friendship. Angell Conwell and Tom "Tiny" Lister Jr. co-star in this urban farce flavored with a hip-hop soundtrack</desc>

    <title lang="en">On the Record With Greta Van Susteren</title>
    <desc lang="en">As part of the ongoing ratings war between rival cable services CNN and The Fox News Network, CNN commentator Greta Van Susteren was wooed to the "other network" with promises of a much larger salary and a nightly interview program of her own. That program, On the Record With Greta Van Susteren, debuted on February 4, 2002. While some observers were mildly surprised that Van Susteren, whose politics tended to be left of center, would agree to star on a cable network with a perceived Conservative slant, most of the press attention concerning the new series was focused on Van Susteren's remarkable cosmetic-surgery makeover, which she insisted had been decided upon long before Fox News Network offered her a job. On the Record With Greta Van Susteren was seen on a Monday through Friday basis from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. EST(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On the Record With Greta Van Susteren</title>
    <desc lang="en">As part of the ongoing ratings war between rival cable services CNN and The Fox News Network, CNN commentator Greta Van Susteren was wooed to the "other network" with promises of a much larger salary and a nightly interview program of her own. That program, On the Record With Greta Van Susteren, debuted on February 4, 2002. While some observers were mildly surprised that Van Susteren, whose politics tended to be left of center, would agree to star on a cable network with a perceived Conservative slant, most of the press attention concerning the new series was focused on Van Susteren's remarkable cosmetic-surgery makeover, which she insisted had been decided upon long before Fox News Network offered her a job. On the Record With Greta Van Susteren was seen on a Monday through Friday basis from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. EST(n)</desc>
