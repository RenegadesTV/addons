    <title lang="en">New Wave: Dare to be Different</title>
    <desc lang="en">In August, 1982, a small group of radio visionaries at WLIR Long Island knew they couldn't compete with the mega radio stations in New York City. With one brave decision, they changed the sound of radio forever. Program Director Denis McNamara, the crew at the station and the biggest artists of the era tell the story of how they battled the FCC, the record labels, mega-radio and all the conventional rules to create a musical movement that brought the New Wave to America - including bands like U2, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode and Blondie.(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch has built his own rival Grim Academy dome on the side of a large, steep hill. He has uprooted trees in order to make room for his Grimdome, but without the roots of trees to hold the soil together the heavy rainfall starts a mudslide down the side of the hill! Mudslides are very powerful and can destroy anything in their path. Glitch and his cadets need rescuing before they are washed away down the hill.(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch has built his own rival Grim Academy dome on the side of a large, steep hill. He has uprooted trees in order to make room for his Grimdome, but without the roots of trees to hold the soil together the heavy rainfall starts a mudslide down the side of the hill! Mudslides are very powerful and can destroy anything in their path. Glitch and his cadets need rescuing before they are washed away down the hill.(n)</desc>
