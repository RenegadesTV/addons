Mum says sometimes it's best to do things slowly and finds some music for Melody to listen to. She has chosen 'Dance of the Knights' from Romeo and Juliet composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Melody imagines two dinosaurs having a race. Initially the smaller dinosaur is winning, but stops to take a rest. The larger dinosaur plods on slowly but surely and wins the race. Melody's verdict is that slow is best.</desc>
