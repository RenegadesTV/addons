Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania. Eksperci spróbują jej pomóc uwierzyć w siebie i przywrócić nadzieję, że wszystko ułoży się po jej myśli</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby.

W towarzystwie jednego z nich Haase wybierze się do Las Vegas, nie wiadomo jednak, czy zamierza tam spróbować szczęścia w kasynie czy wziąć szybki ślub. Gabi dokona przerażającego odkrycia, które jest związane z mężczyzną o imieniu Kalle. Nie zabraknie seksu, trzech propozycji małżeństwa, tajemniczej plantacji marihuany - ale niestety nie oznacza to szczęśliwego zakończenia(n)</desc>

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Little Roy</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Stormy Nighty Knight.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">There's a storm brewing outside and it's making everyone jumpy. Roy tries to help with the snacks for Becky's movie night but a loud rumble of thunder makes him leap and sprawl across the ceiling! Bill and Maura explain that it's normal to be afraid of the storm and that they're perfectly safe, but when the lights go out, Roy whirls into a cartoon panic! He wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy and Finn discover Nighty Knight has cut the power to Toonville and is using his giant shadow to scare the inhabitants. The dynamic duo quickly reveal his trick and send him on his way. Back in reality, Roy is inspired to generate a cartoon light-bulb to keep the dark at bay. Then, when Becky's movie night is cancelled, Roy uses his stretchy skills to entertain everyone with a shadow puppet show.

So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!</desc>
