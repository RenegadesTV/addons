    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jess and Leslie couldn't be more different—she's rich, he's poor, she's from the city, he's from the country—but when Leslie begins to open up the world of imagination to Jess, they find they have something amazing to share: the kingdom of Terabithia, a realm of giants, ogres and other enchanted beings that can only be accessed by boldly swinging across a stream in the woods on a strand of rope. Here, Leslie and Jess rule as King and Queen among the incredible creatures they create, and not even the forces of evil can break their bond.</desc>

Roy tries to help with the snacks for Becky's movie night but a loud rumble of thunder makes him leap and sprawl across the ceiling! Bill and Maura explain that it's normal to be afraid of the storm and that they're perfectly safe, but when the lights go out, Roy whirls into a cartoon panic! He wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy and Finn discover Nighty Knight has cut the power to Toonville and is using his giant shadow to scare the inhabitants. The dynamic duo quickly reveal his trick and send him on his way. Back in reality, Roy is inspired to generate a cartoon light-bulb to keep the dark at bay. Then, when Becky's movie night is cancelled, Roy uses his stretchy skills to entertain everyone with a shadow puppet show. Even when the lights come back on, everyone agrees that they don't need a movie night - Roy is the only entertainment they need!</desc>
