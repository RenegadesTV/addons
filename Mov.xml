    <desc lang="en">Five Oscars, including Best Picture, went to this epic drama about a Roman general who winds up an enslaved gladiator when he refuses to pledge loyalty to the emperor's power-hungry son. After years in the emperor's army, beloved leader Maximus simply wants to go home to his family. But when the dying ruler's scheming son declares himself Caesar, he orders Maximus executed. The resourceful former general promptly escapes, only to resurface later as an enslaved gladiator with revenge on his mind. (cc).(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Hamza,Truc and Anushka: Truc has a little sleep - at school</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.</desc>
