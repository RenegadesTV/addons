    <desc lang="en">Ben Affleck takes over the role of hero CIA agent Jack Ryan in this box office hit based on the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy. Low-level analyst Ryan is elevated to prominence by his expertise on an obscure strongman (Ciaran Hinds) after the politician's surprising ascendancy to the Russian presidency. But that's just the tip of a very large, very lethal iceberg involving neo-Nazis and a nuclear warhead smuggled into the U.S. by terrorists. Morgan Freeman, Bridget Moynihan and Liev Schreiber costar in this espionage adventure.</desc>

In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

A trip to the zoo is next to observe how animals move and to observe their expressions. Writer Michael Rosen pops up to give some advice on their work before setting them the task of making their own illustrated books - the end result is amazing.</desc>

Mum says sometimes it's best to do things slowly and finds some music for Melody to listen to. She has chosen 'Dance of the Knights' from Romeo and Juliet composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Melody imagines two dinosaurs having a race. Initially the smaller dinosaur is winning, but stops to take a rest. The larger dinosaur plods on slowly but surely and wins the race. Melody's verdict is that slow is best.</desc>
