    <desc lang="en">On April 29, 1992, Los Angeles exploded when four police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King. But the city had been smoldering for years. This provocative documentary looks at how decades of racial tensions, injustice and a troubled relationship between the LAPD and the African-American community led to the uprising. Local residents, artists and community organizers share firsthand accounts of police brutality, the ‘65 Watts riots, the rise of LA street gangs and the ‘92 incident.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bloody Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>

    <title lang="en">Whitney. "Can I Be Me"</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.(c)</desc>

A skilled and respected professional at a fancy high-end Italian restaurant in Hamburg, Martha lives a solitary life away from her immaculate kitchen. Yet some life-changing surprises are in store when Martha must take custody of her orphaned eight-year-old niece and her professional domain is invaded by an exuberant new sous-chef (Sergio Castellitto).</desc>

Unfortunately it clashes with a rare comet sighting, which Martha and Ollie are desperate to experience. They have even been allowed to borrow the very precious school telescope for the evening. Ollie is smuggled in to Lily's house by Martha to watch secretly from the attic, with Martha planning to split her time between both events. After much chaos and confusion, and with the presence of Ollie in the house rumbled, a compromise is finally reached, where the girls all get to do both the make-over and watch the rare comet. At the end of the make-over session Martha and Jas are horrified to see Lily has transformed herself to look exactly like Greta in a bid to impress Matt. To spare Lily's feelings they pretend to like her new look, but are relieved the next day in school to see Lily returned to her normal, natural self. Lily has realised it's better to be yourself, rather than try and change who you are just to please others.</desc>
