"A giddy comic fantasy, full of romance, chicanery and beguiling, sophisticated players" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

When their son is killed fighting on the frontlines however, everything changes. They begin pouring their rage and grief into postcards emblazoned with anti-Nazi slogans, risking everything to get their messages of protest across the city. This seemingly small act of subversion rattles the regime, including a police inspector (Daniel Brühl) who will not rest until the culprits have been caught.(n)</desc>

The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

On a hot day in Ghana, five-year-old Tyra cools off at the beach, and builds a massive sandcastle. And in Russia, seven-year-old Liza and her twin brother, Styopa, build a giant plastic tower, only to see it knocked down by their little sister Yulia. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.</desc>

She finds out how posting a letter works as she follows the letter's journey from the post box to the sorting office and finally to the house. Using a special infrared light, Maddie shows us how stamps are scanned to tell if they are first or second class. Next, she visits a factory where colouring pencils are made. She finds out how the coloured crayon inside is made from clay and, using her slow-motion camera, we see the wooden shaft of the pencil being made.</desc>

Preschool drama series about children living on an extraordinary inner-city estate. Mali's dad, Nadeem, has brought Grandma Zainab tickets to watch the cricket - live! When Mali tells his gran that he doesn't want to go and watch the match because 'cricket's boring', he doesn't realise how much he's upset her. Mali is determined to go to Alex's football party instead. It's not until Mali really listens to his friends and some of the adults that he works out what might be the right thing to do to show his gran how much he cares about her.</desc>

She shows us how the surface tension of water changes when we add soap and how we can stop bubbles from bursting with our hands, and using her slow-motion camera, she shows how bubbles make a sphere shape. Next, Maddie heads to a factory where a party favourite is made - chocolate! We learn how chocolate starts out as a fruit, and we see the chocolates being made for an assortment box. Maddie also uses her special camera to see the super-fast robots that put the different chocolates into the right holes in their boxes.(n)</desc>
