    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

Niewiele osób jest w stanie zrozumieć poświęcenie, jakiego wymaga od nich niebezpieczna praca. Ta izolacja odpowiada Beau; mężczyzna z natury jest milczący i nieprzystępny. Dodatkowo zmaga się z wyrzutami sumienia po śmierci brata, który zginął podczas trudnej misji naprawczej. Teraz opiekuje się osieroconą córką zmarłego, Bailey (Kate Bosworth). Nie jest zachwycony, kiedy bratanica zaczyna umawiać się z przystojnym Duncanem. Sympatii Beau nie wzbudza również matka chłopaka (Sharon Stone), która po śmierci męża pogrążyła się w alkoholizmie. Mimo to Duncan dołącza do ekipy monterów. Niedługo potem elektrycy muszą się zmierzyć z poważną awarią sieci energetycznej. Tymczasem nad Teksas nadciąga ogromna nawałnica(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mój grzech obżarstwo</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Beau (John Travolta) zarabia na życie naprawiając linie wysokiego napięcia. Wraz z innymi monterami tworzą zamknięte grono, do którego dostęp mają jedynie nieliczni. Niewiele osób jest w stanie zrozumieć poświęcenie, jakiego wymaga od nich niebezpieczna praca. Ta izolacja odpowiada Beau; mężczyzna z natury jest milczący i nieprzystępny. Dodatkowo zmaga się z wyrzutami sumienia po śmierci brata, który zginął podczas trudnej misji naprawczej. Teraz opiekuje się osieroconą córką zmarłego, Bailey (Kate Bosworth). Nie jest zachwycony, kiedy bratanica zaczyna umawiać się z przystojnym Duncanem. Sympatii Beau nie wzbudza również matka chłopaka (Sharon Stone), która po śmierci męża pogrążyła się w alkoholizmie. Mimo to Duncan dołącza do ekipy monterów. Niedługo potem elektrycy muszą się zmierzyć z poważną awarią sieci energetycznej. Tymczasem nad Teksas nadciąga ogromna nawałnica(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Pond Life.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Mildred's having fun jumping high into the air with Enid - using pirated magic to make the grass bouncy. Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An accident at an asteroid-based mining facility sends the rock hurtling toward the Sun, with crewman Ned Tedford still on-site. Alan and Kayo deploy Thunderbird Three for the rescue mission, but when a rogue solar flare knocks out their sensors, they are forced to find a way to alter the asteroid's trajectory so that it loops around the sun instead of plummeting to its ultra-hot surface. Animated adventure, with the voices of Rasmus Hardiker and Angel Coulby.(n)</desc>
