    <title lang="en">New Wave: Dare to be Different</title>
    <desc lang="en">In August, 1982, a small group of radio visionaries at WLIR Long Island knew they couldn't compete with the mega radio stations in New York City. With one brave decision, they changed the sound of radio forever. Program Director Denis McNamara, the crew at the station and the biggest artists of the era tell the story of how they battled the FCC, the record labels, mega-radio and all the conventional rules to create a musical movement that brought the New Wave to America - including bands like U2, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode and Blondie.</desc>

    <title lang="en">In a Perfect World...</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary that explores the dynamics of what it is to be a man raised by a single mother told through the lens of the director's own relationship with her solo-parented son. Features interviews with men of diverse backgrounds and ages, sharing painfully personal anecdotes in the wake of emotionally turbulent and unsettling periods of their youth. This story is both a deeply personal and introspective portrait of a modern family, as well as a probing cinematic essay examining one of society's major ailments.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Without adopting the romantic and moralistic cliches that have crippled many other films about addiction, Gus Van Sant directs Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, James Le Gros and Heather Graham in one of the most influential films of the late 1980s. Bob (Dillon) is the leader of a small gang of junkies that robs pharmacies and hospitals for prescription drugs. Alas, Bob is now starting to feel the burden of responsibility as he watches over his band of misfits. Van Sant's joyous and exhilarating second feature is notable for its humor and bravery.</desc>
