    <desc lang="en">Prawnik Lenny Rubin (Timothy Spall) marzy o tym, by wreszcie przejść na emeryturę. Za sprawą matki (Honor Blackman) musi jednak zrezygnować na jakiś czas ze swoich planów.

Są wśród nich: pozbawiony skrupułów biznesmen (James Callis), pobożny ojciec i mąż (Hugh O'Conor), mnich buddyjski (Asier Newman) oraz ateistka zaangażowana w obronę praw człowieka w Afryce (Rhona Mitra). Lenny'ego czeka nie lada wyzwanie..(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Prawnik Lenny Rubin (Timothy Spall) marzy o tym, by wreszcie przejść na emeryturę. Za sprawą matki (Honor Blackman) musi jednak zrezygnować na jakiś czas ze swoich planów.

Są wśród nich: pozbawiony skrupułów biznesmen (James Callis), pobożny ojciec i mąż (Hugh O'Conor), mnich buddyjski (Asier Newman) oraz ateistka zaangażowana w obronę praw człowieka w Afryce (Rhona Mitra). Lenny'ego czeka nie lada wyzwanie..(n).</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Possession.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Mary resorts to extreme measures to head off the threat of Cain and PRICE, enlisting KT to help her temporarily transfer her consciousness to Eve. With KT AWOL from Calimov, a distracted Nick and Katherine welcome back Zac, who is helping them answer questions about how Mary was able to duplicate his personality. Excited about Zac's return, Eve suggests he join the gang's picnic that afternoon. To everyone's surprise Zac brings his new girlfriend, and for the first time Eve experiences jealousy. Spotting KT hovering nearby puts Eve on high alert. Operating under Protocol Zero, KT is Mary's automaton, and is primed to execute her mother's plan. Meanwhile, on Abe's misguided advice, Eve kisses Will in an attempt to make Zac jealous. For a moment, in robot communion, Will sees inside Eve's mind and then passes out. In the ensuing chaos, KT places a magnetic patch containing Mary's consciousness onto Eve. Inhabiting Eve's robot body, Mary begins to question Cain about PRICE. Separately, a revived Will tells Lily that when he kissed Eve he could see inside her systems. They theorise that this made her malfunction and fixate on the idea of jealousy - perhaps she is attempting to make Zac jealous by paying Cain so much attention? Little do they realise the truth. Later, Eve - still possessed by Mary - meets Cain in the park, where she interrogates him about PRICE's super-EMP. Mary decides that Cain must be terminated. Will intervenes in the nick of time, kissing Eve again. The disruption to her circuits forces Mary to relinquish control, but Will hears Mary's voice in Eve's mind. The gang are left with a burning question - could Mary be alive.</desc>
