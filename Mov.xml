    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 23)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 24)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni to świnie</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

Lekarka chce dobrze wypaść przed Markiem. Prowadzący badania doktor Sandstorm ignoruje poważne efekty uboczne, które wywołuje nowe lekarstwo. W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać. W tym samym czasie matka Gretchen odkrywa, że jej mąż ma romans z autorką romansideł(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni to świnie</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

Lekarka chce dobrze wypaść przed Markiem. Prowadzący badania doktor Sandstorm ignoruje poważne efekty uboczne, które wywołuje nowe lekarstwo. W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać. W tym samym czasie matka Gretchen odkrywa, że jej mąż ma romans z autorką romansideł(n)</desc>
