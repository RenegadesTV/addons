    <desc lang="en">One-off documentary exploring some of Britain's most bizarre parent-child relationships, where the mums and dads will do anything to look better than their kids. Those featured include 39-year-old Georgina, who was once a frumpy mum but has now followed daughter Kayla by becoming the image of a Barbie doll, complete with fake boobs and lips. Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?(n).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sean Boswell always feels like an outsider, but he defines himself through his victories as a street racer. His hobby makes him unpopular with the authorities, so he goes to live with his father in Japan. Once there and even more alienated, he learns about an exciting, but dangerous, new style of the sport. The stakes are high when Sean takes on the local champion and falls for the man's girlfriend(n).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy wishes he had a cartoon, little brother who wants to play all the time. Not a big sister who gets mad at him. Nodding off, a dream bubble above his head shows Roy playing with Zip-a little, cartoon brother. When Roy wakes up, he is thrilled to find that Zip has hopped out of his dream and into reality. But things don't quite go according to plan! Roy steps out of his room to find an upturned laundry basket on the landing and clothes everywhere! In the kitchen, Zip wolfs down a cake, and out in the garden he creates a grass whirlwind over Bill's newly mowed lawn. While Roy cleans up Zip's mess with a rake, he tells Tristan all about his cartoon brother who escaped from his dream and is causing havoc. Roy realises that having a cartoon brother who wants to play all the time, might not always be such fun. Roy knows they have to get Zip back to Dreamland and wonders - What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, The Messer is wreaking havoc, until Wonder Roy puts a halt to his shenanigans by bringing in The Messer's mother, wisely working out that everyone gets homesick. Back in reality, Tristan and Roy work together to show Zip what he's missing in Dreamland? endless cakes and endless fun! Zip leaps onto Roy's bed and bounces into the dream bubble. Lesson learned, Roy tidies the bedroom for Becky. He finishes, just in the nick of time, as Becky arrives home with some cake to share with her favourite, little cartoon brother(n).</desc>
