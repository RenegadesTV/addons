Here they head straight to an enormous tea plantation where they grow the tea for the British export market. It's been a tough trip for our five teens and within minutes of arriving at the tea factory one of them feels unwell. With a man down how will the other four cope with the very physical work involved? Their boss is the strictest one yet and he is not a man to be messed with. At the end of their first shift the boss proves that he is very serious about tea when he sacks one of the team. They may be shocked but can they pull together as a team to turn this situation around? Show Me What You're Made Of is presented by Stacey Dooley</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Schoolboy Ben is bored witless after being made to stay with his grandma. All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and none other than Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Alexa Gets Stuck in the Mud.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Today we join four-year-old Alexa, her little brother Archie, and Dad as they visit their friends for a weekend in the countryside. Alexa leads everyone on a walk to the forest and they all get stuck in the mud as they splosh through the fields. Later, Alexa and friends enjoy a sleep-over on a big bouncy blow-up bed! They finish their weekend together with a trip to the seaside. Alexa has fun collecting pebbles on a beach but will she be able to run away from the waves so her feet don't get soggy?</desc>
