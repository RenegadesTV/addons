The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A one-off special about Staggering Storytellers, taking a look at some of literature's greatest works and history's wackiest writers. Along the way the development of storytelling technology is observed, it is revealed how a party at Lord Byron's house led to the writing of the Gothic masterpiece Frankenstein, and how Charles Dickens was the Harry Styles of his day. Spanning 3,000 years of recorded history, the programme takes a look at the funny and ridiculous ways some of the finest writers cured their writing block.(n)</desc>
