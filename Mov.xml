For much of the week John Heilemann is embedded with attorney Michael Avenatti, who may just have the most explosive revelations of all.(c)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Caribbean</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The singer embarks on a series of ocean odysseys, and while she is no stranger to the open sea, having found fame on 1998 BBC TV documentary The Cruise, the mega-cruiser she boards is a far cry from the 600-passenger vessel she is used to. In the opening edition, she and her fellow passengers stop off in Nassau in the Bahamas, where Jane finds solace in the state's oldest baptist church, and St Martin, where she seeks an intimate underwater audience with a host of sharks. Back on board, Jane is startled by the scale of everything - from the food and activities to the sheer number of people.</desc>

Jane enjoys unseasonably cloudless skies and sparkling seas as the route takes in the puffin-packed Treshnish Islands and Fingal's Cave on Staffa, the mythic rock formation that famously inspired Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture. The excursion is rounded off with some traditional trappings, from ceilidhs and weaving to haggis-making.</desc>
