W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Długie miesiące poprzedzające ślub nie sprzyjają relaksowi. Suzy wciąż toczy wojny ze świadkiem. Tym razem kością niezgody jest przemowa. Gdy mimo próśb i gróźb zostaje wygłoszona pierwotna wersja, wzburzona panna młoda wylewa na pechowego mówcę zawartość kieliszka. To nie koniec. Suzy powoli się rozkręca. Gdy 4-letnia siostra narzeczonego zakłada ślubny diadem, kobieta wpada w szał. Zdziera go jej z głowy niemal z włosami... Z nietypowymi problemami boryka się Brittany, która bardziej skupia się na ślubnych przygotowaniach niż na fakcie, że odtąd ona i jej partner będą małżeństwem. W imię wyższych celów para zapożycza się i wyprzedaje wszelkie ruchomości. Głównym źródłem finansowania zbliżającej się ceremonii staje się... loteria. Nic dziwnego, że nawet najmniejsze problemy finansowe, stawiają ich ślub pod znakiem zapytania</desc>

Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać. Trener personalny i terapeutka Joanna Godecka podpowiedzą jej co zrobić, aby na nowo otworzyć się na świat i ludzi</desc>

Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać. Trener personalny i terapeutka Joanna Godecka podpowiedzą jej co zrobić, aby na nowo otworzyć się na świat i ludzi</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania. Eksperci spróbują jej pomóc uwierzyć w siebie i przywrócić nadzieję, że wszystko ułoży się po jej myśli</desc>

To nie koniec problemów - Brittany nie zauważa, że jedna z druhen Liz uwodzi jej przyszłego męża. Kulminacja konfliktu ma miejsce w nocy przed ceremonią. Inna z panien z piekła rodem Kim terroryzuje swoją rodzinę i fatalnie przyjmuje krytykę, o odmowie nie wspominając.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Długie miesiące poprzedzające ślub nie sprzyjają relaksowi. Suzy wciąż toczy wojny ze świadkiem. Tym razem kością niezgody jest przemowa. Gdy mimo próśb i gróźb zostaje wygłoszona pierwotna wersja, wzburzona panna młoda wylewa na pechowego mówcę zawartość kieliszka. To nie koniec. Suzy powoli się rozkręca. Gdy 4-letnia siostra narzeczonego zakłada ślubny diadem, kobieta wpada w szał. Zdziera go jej z głowy niemal z włosami... Z nietypowymi problemami boryka się Brittany, która bardziej skupia się na ślubnych przygotowaniach niż na fakcie, że odtąd ona i jej partner będą małżeństwem. W imię wyższych celów para zapożycza się i wyprzedaje wszelkie ruchomości. Głównym źródłem finansowania zbliżającej się ceremonii staje się... loteria. Nic dziwnego, że nawet najmniejsze problemy finansowe, stawiają ich ślub pod znakiem zapytania</desc>

Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać. Trener personalny i terapeutka Joanna Godecka podpowiedzą jej co zrobić, aby na nowo otworzyć się na świat i ludzi</desc>

Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać. Trener personalny i terapeutka Joanna Godecka podpowiedzą jej co zrobić, aby na nowo otworzyć się na świat i ludzi</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania. Eksperci spróbują jej pomóc uwierzyć w siebie i przywrócić nadzieję, że wszystko ułoży się po jej myśli</desc>
