Oboje są przekonani, że chodzi o prawo do opieki nad dzieckiem, jednak na miejscu zszokowani odkrywają, że kobieta prowadzi batalię z L.A. Metropolitan Museum o ogromną roślinę - raflezję zwaną pieszczotliwie Louie. Dr Foley wyhodowała ją z nasiona otrzymanego w tym instytucie naukowym, ale nie zgadza się, by dorosły okaz trafił tam do gabloty. Jest bowiem przekonana, że ją i ten największy kwiat świata łączy szczególna więź. Tymczasem Jane zgadza się reprezentować znajomą Stacy - Kristin, która straciła fortunę w kasynie. Kobieta uważa, że została podstępnie nakłoniona do uprawiania hazardu. Choruje na Parkinsona i powinna unikać alkoholu, a kelner specjalnie przynosił jej kolejne drinki, chociaż nagranie z monitoringu wyraźnie dowodzi, że była już pijana. Z kolei Fred na prośbę Jane zabiera Graystona na drinka do nocnego klubu. Sprawy wymykają się spod kontroli, gdy mężczyzna poznaje tam młodą, seksowną kobietę(n)</desc>

Metropolitan Museum o ogromną roślinę - raflezję zwaną pieszczotliwie Louie. Dr Foley wyhodowała ją z nasiona otrzymanego w tym instytucie naukowym, ale nie zgadza się, by dorosły okaz trafił tam do gabloty. Jest bowiem przekonana, że ją i ten największy kwiat świata łączy szczególna więź. Tymczasem Jane zgadza się reprezentować znajomą Stacy - Kristin, która straciła fortunę w kasynie. Kobieta uważa, że została podstępnie nakłoniona do uprawiania hazardu. Choruje na Parkinsona i powinna unikać alkoholu, a kelner specjalnie przynosił jej kolejne drinki, chociaż nagranie z monitoringu wyraźnie dowodzi, że była już pijana. Z kolei Fred na prośbę Jane zabiera Graystona na drinka do nocnego klubu. Sprawy wymykają się spod kontroli, gdy mężczyzna poznaje tam młodą, seksowną kobietę(n)</desc>
