    <desc lang="en">Orson Welles' follow-up to "Citizen Kane" is this Best Picture nominee, an epic tale of the gradual decline of an old-monied Indianapolis family in the face of turn-of-the-century industrialization. The Ambersons' magnificent lives are apparent as the film opens, as is their sense of propriety. Welles, who directed, produced and adapted the screenplay from Booth Tarkington's novel, also provides the narration. Remade as a 2002 made-for-cable film. (cc).</desc>

The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Twirlywoos are beside a river. They watch a fisherman make his rod longer and longer and longer. The fisherman casts out the line and then settles down for a nap. Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line.(n)</desc>
