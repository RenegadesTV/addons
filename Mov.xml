    <desc lang="en">Two fathers (Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin) join the ranks of the unemployed. They are forced to take their sons out of the exclusive Chapman Academy and become stay-at-home fathers.

As their day care starts to catch on, it launches them into a competition with Chapman Academy's tough-as-nails director (Anjelica Huston) for the hearts and minds of the children.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tough Guys</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1979, more than a decade before the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Bill Viola and Frank Caliguri dream up a contest pitting bar big mouths against wrestlers, martial artists, boxers and brawlers, and bill it as a new no-holds-barred type of competitive fighting. When the fights succeed beyond their wildest expectations, they're swept up in a chain of events that end in the first mixed-martial arts ban in the nation. The film chronicles the inception of Caliguri and Viola's first bouts and the colorful cast of fighters who made them a hit.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Otto and Anna Quangel (Brendan Gleeson &amp; Emma Thompson) are a working-class husband and wife doing their best to ride out the war in Berlin in 1940. When their son is killed fighting on the frontlines however, everything changes. They begin pouring their rage and grief into postcards emblazoned with anti-Nazi slogans, risking everything to get their messages of protest across the city. This seemingly small act of subversion rattles the regime, including a police inspector (Daniel Brühl) who will not rest until the culprits have been caught.(n)</desc>
