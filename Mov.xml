    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Modelka Deb Dobson ginie w wypadku samochodowym i jako duch powraca na ziemię w ciele błyskotliwie inteligentnej, wziętej prawniczki Jane Bingum. Pod nową postacią dwie osobowości kobiety muszą nauczyć się koegzystować. Dla Deb, której świat koncentrował się wokół nieskazitelnego wyglądu, zmiana jest prawdziwym szokiem. Stopniowo jednak przejmuje sposób bycia swojego nowego "puszystego" wcielenia. Jane bierze udział w procesie, w którym po przeciwnych stronach stoją niedoszli państwo młodzi. Kim i Grayson reprezentują surogatkę poszukującą rodziców zastępczych mającego przyjść na świat dziecka</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Pokrewna dusza</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Bezkompromisowy i cyniczny kapitan Fred Cain (Bruno Debrandt) pracuje w wydziale zabójstw. Przed pięcioma laty uległ tragicznemu wypadkowi. Od tej pory porusza się na wózku inwalidzkim. Śledczy znany jest z nietypowych metod działania. Niezwykła intuicja sprawia, że z łatwością odgaduje słabości innych. Niekiedy też zdarza się mu łamać obowiązujące procedury. Jego zawodową partnerką jest detektyw Lucie Delambre (Julie Delarme). W życiu prywatnym Caine próbuje uporać się z rozwodem. Kłopotów przysparza mu również dorastający syn, Ben (Davy Sanna)</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her</desc>

Roy tries to help with the snacks for Becky's movie night but a loud rumble of thunder makes him leap and sprawl across the ceiling! Bill and Maura explain that it's normal to be afraid of the storm and that they're perfectly safe, but when the lights go out, Roy whirls into a cartoon panic! He wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy and Finn discover Nighty Knight has cut the power to Toonville and is using his giant shadow to scare the inhabitants. The dynamic duo quickly reveal his trick and send him on his way. Back in reality, Roy is inspired to generate a cartoon light-bulb to keep the dark at bay. Then, when Becky's movie night is cancelled, Roy uses his stretchy skills to entertain everyone with a shadow puppet show. Even when the lights come back on, everyone agrees that they don't need a movie night - Roy is the only entertainment they need!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">There's a storm brewing outside and it's making everyone jumpy. Roy tries to help with the snacks for Becky's movie night but a loud rumble of thunder makes him leap and sprawl across the ceiling! Bill and Maura explain that it's normal to be afraid of the storm and that they're perfectly safe, but when the lights go out, Roy whirls into a cartoon panic! He wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy and Finn discover Nighty Knight has cut the power to Toonville and is using his giant shadow to scare the inhabitants. The dynamic duo quickly reveal his trick and send him on his way. Back in reality, Roy is inspired to generate a cartoon light-bulb to keep the dark at bay. Then, when Becky's movie night is cancelled, Roy uses his stretchy skills to entertain everyone with a shadow puppet show. Even when the lights come back on, everyone agrees that they don't need a movie night - Roy is the only entertainment they need!</desc>
