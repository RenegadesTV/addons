    <title lang="en">Sesame Street</title>
    <desc lang="en">A landmark series set in an ethnically diverse urban neighborhood where every day is a sunny one. It features songs, skits, animation and, of course, Muppets to teach preschoolers basic educational and social concepts. A public-television gem that's older than PBS itself, 'Sesame Street' debuted in 1969 on National Educational Television. Since that time, this influential show has won more Emmys than any other in TV history (more than 90 at last count) and can be seen in more than 140 countries. (cc)(c)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Hamburger Hill</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Trwa wojna w Wietnamie. Do wilgotnej, parnej dżungli przyjeżdżają nowe oddziały amerykańskich żołnierzy. Ci, którzy znajdują się tu do miesięcy, odliczają dni do końca swojej służby. Pozostali próbują przystosować się do panujących tu trudnych warunków. Wkrótce nadchodzi rozkaz zdobycia jednego ze wzgórz, oznaczonego na mapach numerem 937. Rozpoczyna się niezwykle krwawa walka. Przez dziesięć dni Amerykanie desperacko zmagają się z siłami Wietnamu Północnego. Kolejne próby zdobycia ufortyfikowanego, silnie bronionego wzgórza kończą się niepowodzeniem. Rozpaczliwą sytuację pogarsza jeszcze ulewny deszcz. Oparty na faktach brutalny i realistyczny film o wymowie antywojennej ukazuje jeden z najkrwawszych epizodów wojny w Wietnamie. Z powodu wielkiej liczby ofiar, których ciała zostały zmasakrowane przez ogień przeciwnika, miejsce, o które toczyły się walki, zyskało nazwę "Hamburger Hill"</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Rachel Allen pokazuje, jak łatwo, szybko i tanio przygotować pyszne dania na każdy dzień. Dzieli się przepisami na potrawy, które nie wymagają spędzenia wielu godzin w kuchni. Wśród jej propozycji są zarówno dania obiadowe, jak i atrakcyjnie wyglądające desery. Święta Bożego Narodzenia to znakomity czas, by pochwalić się swoimi umiejętnościami kulinarnymi podnoszonymi przez cały rok. Rachel prezentuje tu pełnię swoich możliwości: cynamonowe mascarpone, szynka glazurowana i rozpływający się w ustach indyk - to tylko niektóre z propozycji, które mogą pojawić się na świątecznym stole. W odcinku szkółki kucharskiej dla odmiany ręcznie robione podarunki w sam raz na Boże Narodzenie</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Hamburger Hill</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Trwa wojna w Wietnamie. Do wilgotnej, parnej dżungli przyjeżdżają nowe oddziały amerykańskich żołnierzy. Ci, którzy znajdują się tu do miesięcy, odliczają dni do końca swojej służby. Pozostali próbują przystosować się do panujących tu trudnych warunków. Wkrótce nadchodzi rozkaz zdobycia jednego ze wzgórz, oznaczonego na mapach numerem 937. Rozpoczyna się niezwykle krwawa walka. Przez dziesięć dni Amerykanie desperacko zmagają się z siłami Wietnamu Północnego. Kolejne próby zdobycia ufortyfikowanego, silnie bronionego wzgórza kończą się niepowodzeniem. Rozpaczliwą sytuację pogarsza jeszcze ulewny deszcz. Oparty na faktach brutalny i realistyczny film o wymowie antywojennej ukazuje jeden z najkrwawszych epizodów wojny w Wietnamie. Z powodu wielkiej liczby ofiar, których ciała zostały zmasakrowane przez ogień przeciwnika, miejsce, o które toczyły się walki, zyskało nazwę "Hamburger Hill"</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>
