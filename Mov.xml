He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

    <title lang="en">68 Kill</title>
    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.(n)</desc>

On a hot day in Ghana, five-year-old Tyra cools off at the beach, and builds a massive sandcastle. And in Russia, seven-year-old Liza and her twin brother, Styopa, build a giant plastic tower, only to see it knocked down by their little sister Yulia. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>
