    <title lang="en">Daddy Day Care</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two fathers (Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin) join the ranks of the unemployed. They are forced to take their sons out of the exclusive Chapman Academy and become stay-at-home fathers. With no job possibilities on the horizon, the two dads decide to open their own day care facility, which boasts some fairly unconventional methods of tending the kids. As their day care starts to catch on, it launches them into a competition with Chapman Academy's tough-as-nails director (Anjelica Huston) for the hearts and minds of the children</desc>
