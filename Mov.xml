    <title lang="en">Lenny Cooke</title>
    <desc lang="en">In an era when high school stars were forgoing college hoops in favor of the multi-million dollar contracts promised in the NBA draft, Lenny was supposed to be the next superstar. But over a decade later, while his peers are taking home MVP awards and championship trophies, Lenny has never played a minute in the NBA. What went wrong? A quintessentially American story about dreaming big, the fickle nature of sports celebrity and the unfulfilled destiny of a man for whom superstardom was only just out of reach</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Karolina została przyjęta do szpitala warunkowo, bo znowu przytyła. Coraz bardziej dokucza jej ból kręgosłupa. Prof. Paśnik kwalifikuje ją do operacji. Z kolei 40-letni Artur jest bohaterem pierwszej edycji "Sali operacyjnej", kiedy to jego waga wynosiła 150 kg. Po zabiegu schudł 55 kg i nadal trzyma formę. Artur stara się wykorzystać swoją wiedzę i doświadczenie, by pomagać innym. Przyjechał do szpitala na konsultację z dietetykiem, bo pomimo starań przestał chudnąć. Dodatkowym problemem jest wisząca skóra - pamiątka po utraconych kilogramach. Tymczasem Ela zdecydowała się wreszcie iść na zakupy po nowe ubrania</desc>

Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Młody mężczyzna ma raka języka. Specjaliści starają się usunąć guza tak, by pacjent nie stracił mowy. Widzowie poznają też historię dziewczyny, która cierpi z powodu bardzo wysuniętej żuchwy</desc>

Z kolei 40-letni Artur jest bohaterem pierwszej edycji "Sali operacyjnej", kiedy to jego waga wynosiła 150 kg. Po zabiegu schudł 55 kg i nadal trzyma formę. Artur stara się wykorzystać swoją wiedzę i doświadczenie, by pomagać innym. Przyjechał do szpitala na konsultację z dietetykiem, bo pomimo starań przestał chudnąć. Dodatkowym problemem jest wisząca skóra - pamiątka po utraconych kilogramach. Tymczasem Ela zdecydowała się wreszcie iść na zakupy po nowe ubrania</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Prezentacja prawdziwych, najczęściej wykonywanych w Polsce, zabiegów chirurgicznych. Tu nie ma miejsca na scenariusz. Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Młody mężczyzna został pchnięty nożem. Lekarze, by go ratować, decydują się na nowatorski zabieg wszczepienia zastawki trójdzielnej - to druga taka operacja w historii polskiej kardiochirurgii</desc>
