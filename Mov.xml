    <desc lang="en">Without adopting the romantic and moralistic cliches that have crippled many other films about addiction, Gus Van Sant directs Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, James Le Gros and Heather Graham in one of the most influential films of the late 1980s. Bob (Dillon) is the leader of a small gang of junkies that robs pharmacies and hospitals for prescription drugs. Alas, Bob is now starting to feel the burden of responsibility as he watches over his band of misfits. Van Sant's joyous and exhilarating second feature is notable for its humor and bravery.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Whitney: Can I Be Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Harry Potter: A History of Magic</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary exploring the myths, traditions and everyday artefacts that inspired JK Rowling as she crafted the wizarding world depicted in her celebrated Harry Potter series. The British Library is marking the 20th anniversary of the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with an exhibition showcasing unseen manuscripts, drawings, drafts and personal items from Rowling's private archives, and this programme sheds light on how the objects on display helped to fire the author's imagination over the course of the past two decades. Famous fans offer playful readings that recreate some of the best-loved spells, potion recipes and magical moments from the books, and the programme introduces individuals who have made the magic of the novels a reality, from real-life wand-makers to passionate Quidditch enthusiasts. Narrated by Imelda Staunton.(n)</desc>
