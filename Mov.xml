When Jas and her dad suggest `shaking it up' a bit this year and introducing a Mexican theme, it leads first of all to the parents falling out and then to Martha and Jas themselves. It's the battle of the lobster vs the Mexican donkey pinata called Percy.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Salford Curse</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Jas decides to follow in her dad's footsteps and try out for the junior hockey team. Mr Salford was a legendary hockey goalie in his time at the school. When the try-outs are cancelled due to the coach not being available, Mr Salford steps in and offers his services as coach. Mrs Griggs is horrified - she could do without the chaos he inevitably brings with him - but he won't take no for an answer. Jas and her father are really superstitious and when things start going wrong Jas thinks she's jinxed, and then that she's passed on the jinx to her dad. When she's not picked as goalie for the team Jas is actually relieved - it must mean she's still jinxed and hasn't passed on the jinx to her dad. Eventually Jas does need to play in goal, but when she saves a crucial penalty she and her dad are delighted to realise they are not jinxed after all, just accident-prone! Meanwhile, Martha &amp; Ollie get paranoid that Cassie &amp; Maxwell are usurping them. They've taken over their favourite nook in the library and when they turn up to do their regular security check on Mrs Rennison's computer Cassie and Maxwell have already been there and done it. They decide they've got to get their own back and they sabotage a fizzy drinks maker Cassie and Maxwell have created to provide refreshments at the hockey match. They turn up the CO2 dial and everyone gets very burpy! Lily is feeling abandoned by her friends - they all seem too busy to hang out with her. Matt advises her that a big gesture could do the trick. When she unfurls a giant banner during the hockey match declaring her admiration for her friends it's really embarrassing. It does prompt Martha and Ollie to do the right thing, though, and confess to Cassie and Maxwell that they sabotaged their fizzy drinks machine and does inspire Jas to save that crucial penalty.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Eye Contact 101</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Mrs Griggs decides that a 'social skills' class could be beneficial for certain pupils - including Martha, Rufus, Cassie and Maxwell. When Mrs Griggs tells Martha a winning personality as well as academic achievement is vital in order to get into a top university, Martha panics and is determined to succeed in the social skills class and prove she does indeed have a winning personality. Mrs Griggs volunteers a reluctant Mr Malone to take the classes and hands him a book written by her beloved 'Guru Holeman' called Being Whole as a manual to help him. When Lily is mistakenly led to believe by Jas that Matt is emigrating to Australia she is distraught that he hasn't even told her he's leaving. She becomes convinced it's because she's too easy-going that he hasn't even bothered to tell her. She begs Mrs Griggs to let her go to social skills class, too, so she can learn to be less easy-going. Ollie is then sent there for being too pompous and Jas for being too exuberant. Worn down, eventually Mr Malone has had enough of teaching the class Mrs Griggs' way. He throws the book in the bin and gives the pupils a new exercise of his own - wearing blindfolds so they can feel free without worrying how people see them. It works - a blindfolded Lily is able to tell Matt she'll really miss him when he emigrates, which prompts Matt to tell her that he's not going anywhere. And Martha realises she's doing just fine with the personality she already has.</desc>
