    <desc lang="en">Claire has been asked to the senior prom, but Michael won't let her go. Their compromise: Michael and Jay will chaperone. Suffice it to say that Jay thinks more of the plan than Claire does (or than Michael does, at first). Meanwhile, Jr's rehabbing an old car and he wants Michael to pay for it. Michael agrees, but that isn't necessarily good news for Jr. Donovan: Roshawn Franklin. (repeat)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Part 1 of 2: Jr.'s high-school graduation is approaching and he drops a bombshell: He wants to go to college. Perhaps not surprisingly, it's the same one that his girlfriend Vanessa (Meagan Good) plans to attend. Trouble is, it's hard to get into, but Michael thinks he knows how to deal with that. Meanwhile, Claire and Kady can't wait to get rid of their older brother, and neither can Franklin (Noah Gray-Cabey). (repeat)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Part 1 of two. Michael and Jay react predictably (which is to say not at all well) to the news that Jr. has impregnated his girlfriend, Vanessa. But Michael is determined to make a man of his son. “I've got only nine months to take him from dummy to daddy,” he tells Jay. “I've got to teach him that there's no free ride.” First, he gives him a job at his trucking company. Brooklyn Sudano joins the cast as Vanessa (taking over from Megan Good). Tony: Andrew McFarlane. Franklin: Noah Gray-Cabey. (repeat)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Claire has been asked to the senior prom, but Michael won't let her go. Their compromise: Michael and Jay will chaperone. Suffice it to say that Jay thinks more of the plan than Claire does (or than Michael does, at first). Meanwhile, Jr's rehabbing an old car and he wants Michael to pay for it. Michael agrees, but that isn't necessarily good news for Jr. Donovan: Roshawn Franklin. (repeat)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Part 1 of 2: Jr.'s high-school graduation is approaching and he drops a bombshell: He wants to go to college. Perhaps not surprisingly, it's the same one that his girlfriend Vanessa (Meagan Good) plans to attend. Trouble is, it's hard to get into, but Michael thinks he knows how to deal with that. Meanwhile, Claire and Kady can't wait to get rid of their older brother, and neither can Franklin (Noah Gray-Cabey). (repeat)(n)</desc>

But Michael is determined to make a man of his son. “I've got only nine months to take him from dummy to daddy,” he tells Jay. “I've got to teach him that there's no free ride.” First, he gives him a job at his trucking company.

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school</desc>

Today teams invade an office building and for unsuspecting targets, it's going to be anything but another... day at the office!

For the winning team, Marc, Andy and Devon have planned a MEGA PRANK packed with ninja power! The setting is a martial arts dojo, complete with flying rigs, flying crates and flying people!
