    <desc lang="en">Ben Affleck takes over the role of hero CIA agent Jack Ryan in this box office hit based on the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy. Low-level analyst Ryan is elevated to prominence by his expertise on an obscure strongman (Ciaran Hinds) after the politician's surprising ascendancy to the Russian presidency.

Morgan Freeman, Bridget Moynihan and Liev Schreiber costar in this espionage adventure.</desc>

Flynn, has pled guilty to lying to the FBI, bringing the Russia investigation closer to Trump’s inner circle. As the paper leads the reporting on workplace sexual harassment, allegations of past misconduct by one reporter in the bureau bring the story home. And for all the attacks on the free press over the course of Trump’s first year in office, the paper is rewarded for what it does best: good reporting.(c)</desc>

But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

With a party to organise the gang get to work - Matilda's brother Jack and sisters Megan and Holly take shopping to another level as they speed along the river Thames on a high-performance rib to pick up supplies.

The popcorn cakes idea came from Scarlet, a Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch viewer who emailed it to Matilda's Food Blog. Great food, friends and fun, and the party finishing with a bang when the guys play an explosive game with a watermelon - parties don't get much better!</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit.</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit.</desc>
