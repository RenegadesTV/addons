W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek.

    <sub-title lang="pl">Tout sur Lucie</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Czekająca na tajemnicze spotkanie Lucie zostaje postrzelona. Wszystko to dzieje się na oczach Caina. Kiedy kobieta trafia na oddział intensywnej terapii, detektyw musi sam poprowadzić dochodzenie. Moretti ma wątpliwości, czy targające Cainem emocje pozwolą mu zachować zdrowy rozsądek. W trakcie śledztwa detektyw dokładnie analizuje swoją relację z Lucie, uświadamia sobie, jak mało o niej wie. Odkrywa, że jego partnerka wynajęła ostatnio drugie mieszkanie. Tymczasem nieprzytomna Lucie w malignie przypomina sobie wydarzenia ostatnich 15 dni. W jej głowie mieszają się one ze wcześniejszymi wspomnieniami. Ona wie, kto do niej strzelał(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Melody and her mum arrive at The Purcell School, to see her friend Noah, who plays the Cello. Mum and Melody arrive in the corridor where they can hear the Cello. They find Noah who shows Melody the parts of the Cello and demonstrates the sounds it makes. Melody and her mum then hurry to meet Melody's friends who are also going to watch Noah give a recital of Archduke by Beethoven. Melody is looking forward to knowing what the music will make her friends think of. The music begins, and Melody's imagination, with the help of animation gets to work. Mum and Melody then go and meet the friends. The music is played again and with animation we see what the music makes them think of, from Fudge in a forest to floating feathers(n)</desc>
