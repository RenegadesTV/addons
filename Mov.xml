    <desc lang="en">It's just another day at the Furchester Hotel, that is until the Furball, a bouncing furry monster ball, arrives in a flurry of bouncing and chanting! Soon all the Furchesters are jumping and chanting 'Furball!' too. Elmo asks why they are all shouting 'Furball' and Furgus says that it's because the Furball has arrived, it's the best game ever, whenever he turns up at the hotel they all play a game of 'Furball', he's very excited and goes to get his Furball equipment bag and everything is there except his Furball shoes. Furgus and Funella go to look for his shoes and tell Phoebe and Elmo to keep an eye on the Furball and not let him out of their sight. Just at that moment, the Furball disappears, only for them to spot him up on the balcony, they're soon chasing him all over the hotel. Phoebe decides to look in her Dad's Furball bag and finds a Furball net, they hear boinging and get ready to pounce, but they catch a very suspicious looking rabbit instead. Cookie Monster then comes along and tells them to use Furball bait - a cookie! They put the cookie in the Furball net and wait, but instead of catching a Furball they catch Cookie Monster instead, with which he remembers that cookies are Cookie Monster bait, not Furball bait</desc>
