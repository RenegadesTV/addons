    <title lang="en">Bloody Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mr Stink</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Twelve-year-old Chloe leads a lonely existence - her mother is too busy with her political ambitions to take any interest in her daughter, her hen-pecked dad is hiding a secret of his own and she cannot hope to compete with her `perfect' younger sister - to say nothing of the nasty girls who make her school life a misery. So when she meets a tramp in need of somewhere to stay, she invites him to hide in her family's garden shed - but it soon turns out there is more to her smelly guest than meets the eye. Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville stars, with Sheridan Smith, Johnny Vegas and Isabella Blake-Thomas, and an appearance from Britain's Got Talent winner Pudsey the dog.(n)</desc>
