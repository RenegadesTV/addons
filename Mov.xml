    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley</desc>
