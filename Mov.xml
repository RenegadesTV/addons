    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni to świnie</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie</desc>

W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać. W tym samym czasie matka Gretchen odkrywa, że jej mąż ma romans z autorką romansideł</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Czy jestem gruba?</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Gretchen bierze udział w testach nowych tabletek na odchudzanie w nadziei, że pomogą one zrzucić kilka kilogramów przed imprezą bikini na basenie. Lekarka chce dobrze wypaść przed Markiem. Prowadzący badania doktor Sandstorm ignoruje poważne efekty uboczne, które wywołuje nowe lekarstwo. W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać. W tym samym czasie matka Gretchen odkrywa, że jej mąż ma romans z autorką romansideł</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni to świnie</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni są najlepszym lekarstwem</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie</desc>

Lekarka chce dobrze wypaść przed Markiem. Prowadzący badania doktor Sandstorm ignoruje poważne efekty uboczne, które wywołuje nowe lekarstwo. W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać. W tym samym czasie matka Gretchen odkrywa, że jej mąż ma romans z autorką romansideł</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni są najlepszym lekarstwem</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie</desc>

Lekarka chce dobrze wypaść przed Markiem. Prowadzący badania doktor Sandstorm ignoruje poważne efekty uboczne, które wywołuje nowe lekarstwo. W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać. W tym samym czasie matka Gretchen odkrywa, że jej mąż ma romans z autorką romansideł</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Doktor Kaan jest milutki!</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Haase odkrywa, że doktor Kaan może i uchodzi za dziwaka, lecz ma dobre serce. Lekarz udziela nieodpłatnej pomocy osobom, których nie stać na leczenie. Gretchen i doktor Hassmann, neurochirurg, operują Jenny, dziewczynę z nizin społecznych, która ukradła lekarce portfel. Gaby obmyśla plan, jak usidlić Meiera. Wpada na pewien pomysł. Barbara zapisuje się z córką na zajęcia z fitnessu, by podnieść swoją atrakcyjność w oczach męża. W ośrodku zdrowia wpada na kochankę męża, Elke. Wynikają z tego duże kłopoty, gdyż Gretchen nie umie trzymać języka za zębami(n)</desc>

It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">RANK THE PRANK - pranking Hollywood style! Today our pesky pranksters are Dukafundis (Markus and Ellysa) and 'Very Intelligent Pranksters' (Evan and Ashazia) who team up with digital effects wizard Hassan Aziz and SFX specialists Marc Reichel and Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. The teams take over a bowling alley and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's strike three for the targets when Markus and Ellysa's 'Haunted Alley' dukes it out with Evan and Ashazia's 'Hotdog Bowler'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, the effectors have planned the ultimate MEGA PRANK at a car wash featuring a dirty car, a nervous driver and a meteor shower! Our 'target' may be able to avoid the meteor but will mom's car be able to do the same? One thing's for sure, this explosively entertaining mega prank strikes comedy gold!(n)</desc>
