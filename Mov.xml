W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

W czwartym sezonie główna bohaterka coraz bardziej angażuje się w związek z sędzią Owenem Frenchem, z którym spędziła cudowne chwile we Włoszech. Tymczasem Grayson Kent (Jackson Hurst) zaczyna domyślać się, kim Jane jest naprawdę. Myśl o tym, że koleżanka z pracy to jego ukochana Deb, dręczy go i prowokuje wiele tragikomicznych sytuacji. W końcu, w dzień ślubu Jane, mężczyzna postanawia ujawnić swoje uczucia do niej. W tym sezonie prawniczka otrzymuje również nowego anioła stróża - Freda zastąpi w tej roli Luke (Carter MacIntyre)(n)</desc>

W Norwegi zamierzają nakręcić własną adaptację dramatu Henrika Ibsena "Oblubienica morza". Okazuje się, że z pozoru proste zadanie przerasta filmowców - w pracy przeszkadzają im surrealistyczne otoczenie oraz nigdy się niekończący dzień polarny. Wszystko to dodatkowo zaostrza dzielące grupę konflikty. Niecodzienne warunki mają też wpływ zarówno na samych artystów, jak i tworzone przez nich dzieło. Po licznych wzlotach i upadkach udaje im się z sukcesem ukończyć pracę nad filmem(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej.
