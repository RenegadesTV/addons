    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.(n)</desc>

Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy is helping to spring clean and is having fun, until Maura decides that Roy should go through his toys and give away the ones he doesn't play with anymore. Roy can't believe it ­ he loves all of his toys and doesn't want to give any to Mrs Barker's Charity Shop, The Old Bag. Roy isn't the only family member having trouble parting with their old, unused items. Bill becomes incredibly attached to some old tight fitting clothes, and there's a scarf Maura has her eye on too. Mr Barker is just as reluctant as Roy, and when Mrs Barker is about to catch them both hiding out in Reg's shed, Roy wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy loses his brand new cape in a villainous encounter with The Messer and Glitterella. He had given Finn his old cape ­ much to Finn's delight, and is reluctant to take it back, but Finn reassures him that who we are is much more important than the things we own. Back in reality, Roy remembers this, and teaches Mr Barker how good it feels to pass things on!</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Roy's New Look</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Roy is intrigued when Joan calls over to style Maura and Becky's hair. Bill suggests Roy should use his natural creative talent to try styling Maura and Becky. Roy gives it a go and is delighted with the results. Maura, Becky, Bill and Joan are all amazed with the work Roy does on changing their looks. Roy is eager to have a makeover of his own. Joan does the honours, but every time she changes Roy's hairstyle, it plops back to its original appearance. Roy is crestfallen to realise he cannot change the way he looks. What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, Wonder Roy combats Gliterella with his new creation - a soapy water pistol. But, being Wonder Roy, he allows her the creative freedom to add a bit of sparkle to the dreary local library. Back in reality, Roy uses his creativity to fashion a wig for himself, but sadly accepts he is wasting his time. Bill points Roy's cartoon uniqueness and creative flair is something to be proud of. Roy finds solace in his dad's words and celebrates the fact he is a genius when it comes to making over people and in transforming the world around him with creativity.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Hamza,Truc and Anushka: Truc has a little sleep - at school</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.</desc>
