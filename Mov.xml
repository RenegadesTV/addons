It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Melody and her mother arrive at the Purcell School, to see her friend Ned, who plays the guitar.The pair stand in the corridor where they can hear different instruments playing. They find Ned who shows Melody the electric guitar and acoustic guitar and demonstrates the sounds they make. Melody and her mum then hurry to meet Melody's friends who are also going to watch Ned give a recital of Bach's Cello Suite, No 2, First Movement. Melody is looking forward to knowing what the music will make her friends think of. The music begins, and Melody's imagination, with the help of animation gets to work. Mum and Melody then go and meet the friends, where the music is played again and with animation we see what the music makes the friends think of.(n)</desc>
