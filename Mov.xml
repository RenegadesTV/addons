    <desc lang="pl">Jane ma złamane serce, gdyż jej narzeczony skłamał, że wybiera się do kolegi w Seattle, i zniknął bez śladu. Prawniczka zgadza się pomóc Chloe Surnow - nastoletniej córce jej przyjaciółki sprzed lat - która została oskarżona o zabójstwo koleżanki z klasy, Brittney Hollis. Wiele wskazuje na to, że dziewczyna jest winna, zwłaszcza plamy krwi ofiary na jej ubraniu. Tylko jedno wydaje się Jane zastanawiające - lokalizator w telefonie komórkowym wskazuje, że na miejscu zbrodni była wtedy obecna młodsza siostra oskarżonej, Michelle. Prawniczka analizuje ten fakt i przy okazji odkrywa prawdę o innej zbrodni sprzed kilku lat. Tymczasem wszystko wskazuje na to, że Gina Blunt (Mädchen Amick) wkrótce dołączy do zespołu Harrison &amp; Parker. Teri jej nie znosi, ponieważ pamięta, jak zachowywała się w poprzedniej pracy. Jednakże Parker chce, by kobieta wykupiła ich wierzytelności, i wysyła ją na kolację z Graystonem</desc>

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości.

    <desc lang="pl">Jane ma złamane serce, gdyż jej narzeczony skłamał, że wybiera się do kolegi w Seattle, i zniknął bez śladu. Prawniczka zgadza się pomóc Chloe Surnow - nastoletniej córce jej przyjaciółki sprzed lat - która została oskarżona o zabójstwo koleżanki z klasy, Brittney Hollis. Wiele wskazuje na to, że dziewczyna jest winna, zwłaszcza plamy krwi ofiary na jej ubraniu. Tylko jedno wydaje się Jane zastanawiające - lokalizator w telefonie komórkowym wskazuje, że na miejscu zbrodni była wtedy obecna młodsza siostra oskarżonej, Michelle. Prawniczka analizuje ten fakt i przy okazji odkrywa prawdę o innej zbrodni sprzed kilku lat. Tymczasem wszystko wskazuje na to, że Gina Blunt (Mädchen Amick) wkrótce dołączy do zespołu Harrison &amp; Parker. Teri jej nie znosi, ponieważ pamięta, jak zachowywała się w poprzedniej pracy. Jednakże Parker chce, by kobieta wykupiła ich wierzytelności, i wysyła ją na kolację z Graystonem</desc>

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości. Jej siostra Sarah (Lizzy Caplan) ma odmienne niż ona poglądy na życie. Kobieta w zupełnie inny sposób podchodzi do relacji z płcią przeciwną.

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her(n)</desc>
