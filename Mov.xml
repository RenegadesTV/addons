    <desc lang="en">Nine Russian hikers venture into a remote area of the Ural Mountains. Two weeks later, all nine are found dead. Five ambitious American college students are issued a grant to return to the site of the original events in the belief that they can uncover and document the truth of what happened. Their trek through the mountains, retracing the steps of that ill-fated journey, is plagued by strange and increasingly terrifying phenomena, all of which suggest that they are not alone. The forces behind the Dyatlov Pass Incident are waiting for them.(n)</desc>

Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred.</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast.
