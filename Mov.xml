With this eye-opening drama, he looks at this avoidable human catastrophe from a somewhat different perspective. Featuring music by Tom Waits</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One-off documentary exploring some of Britain's most bizarre parent-child relationships, where the mums and dads will do anything to look better than their kids. Those featured include 39-year-old Georgina, who was once a frumpy mum but has now followed daughter Kayla by becoming the image of a Barbie doll, complete with fake boobs and lips. Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?.</desc>

Dotąd obie kobiety nie wiedziały o swoim istnieniu. Teraz postanawiają razem wnieść do sądu sprawę przeciwko Charlesowi. Ich reprezentantką zostaje Jane. Na sali rozpraw okazuje się, że obrońcą oskarżanego o bigamię mężczyzny jest Tony Nicastro, były chłopak Bingum. Tymczasem Kim obawia się, że może być w ciąży. Mimo tego zgadza się reprezentować przed sądem przyjaciółkę, Caitlin Tanner. Chce ona odzyskać dziecko, które urodziła dla niej surogatka, Lana Dooley. Dziewczyna dostała pieniądze, a następnie porwała niemowlę z domu Caitlin. Kim podejrzewa, że za uprowadzeniem nie kryją się wcale rozbudzone uczucia macierzyńskie..</desc>

Miasteczko Aleksandria leży na samej granicy konfliktu, który podzielił stany Północy i Południa. W mieszczącym się tam hotelu Mansion House powstaje szpital polowy założony przez okupujące miasto wojska Unii. To właśnie tam krzyżują się drogi dwóch wolontariuszek: stojącej po stronie Północy pielęgniarki Mary Phinney (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) oraz Emmy Green (Hannah James), słynącej z piękności zwolenniczki Konfederatów. Życiem mieszkańców Aleksandrii rządzą bezlitosny przypadek, nienawiść, wola przetrwania i - mimo wszystko - nadzieja</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Helen Wakefield publicznie policzkuje Jacka Bryanta, trenera szkolnej drużyny koszykówki. Mężczyzna doznaje poważnej kontuzji szyi i domaga się odszkodowania za utratę zdrowia. Helen uderzyła szkoleniowca, gdyż dyskryminował jej córkę, nie pozwalając ośmiolatce grać w pierwszym składzie zespołu. Zamiast niej wystawiał swoje dziecko. Sprawa wydaje się przesądzona, gdyż wina Helen jest bezsprzeczna. Jane postanawia jednak wykorzystać przed sądem pewne informacje o Bryancie, które zdobyła jeszcze jako Deb. Wkrótce Teri wzywa Bingum na posterunek policji. Razem z kuzynem Edwardem została bowiem aresztowana za zakłócanie porządku publicznego. Sprawa jest jednak poważniejsza, gdyż Edwardowi grozi deportacja do Korei Płd. Mężczyzna jest w szoku, gdyż całe życie spędził w USA. Jedyną szansą, by go ocalić jest wyjawienie mu rodzinnej tajemnicy związanej z jego urodzeniem. Tony dostaje awans. W związku z tym musi przeprowadzić się do Waszyngtonu. Bingum zastanawia się, czy wyjechać razem z nim(n)</desc>

Dotąd obie kobiety nie wiedziały o swoim istnieniu. Teraz postanawiają razem wnieść do sądu sprawę przeciwko Charlesowi. Ich reprezentantką zostaje Jane. Na sali rozpraw okazuje się, że obrońcą oskarżanego o bigamię mężczyzny jest Tony Nicastro, były chłopak Bingum. Tymczasem Kim obawia się, że może być w ciąży. Mimo tego zgadza się reprezentować przed sądem przyjaciółkę, Caitlin Tanner. Chce ona odzyskać dziecko, które urodziła dla niej surogatka, Lana Dooley. Dziewczyna dostała pieniądze, a następnie porwała niemowlę z domu Caitlin. Kim podejrzewa, że za uprowadzeniem nie kryją się wcale rozbudzone uczucia macierzyńskie..</desc>

Miasteczko Aleksandria leży na samej granicy konfliktu, który podzielił stany Północy i Południa. W mieszczącym się tam hotelu Mansion House powstaje szpital polowy założony przez okupujące miasto wojska Unii. To właśnie tam krzyżują się drogi dwóch wolontariuszek: stojącej po stronie Północy pielęgniarki Mary Phinney (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) oraz Emmy Green (Hannah James), słynącej z piękności zwolenniczki Konfederatów. Życiem mieszkańców Aleksandrii rządzą bezlitosny przypadek, nienawiść, wola przetrwania i - mimo wszystko - nadzieja</desc>

Ma też lekką asymetrię lewej części twarzy i problemy ze wzrokiem. Wizja powikłań sprawiła, że uciekała przed decyzją o operacji przez kilka lat. Próbowała leczyć się przy pomocy medycyny naturalnej, a nawet jogi. Od pewnego czasu guz zaczął jednak rosnąć w zastraszającym tempie, co zmusiło Olgę do podjęcia decyzji o leczeniu. Uwierzyła, że dr Głowacki ze Szpitala Zachodniego w Grodzisku Mazowieckim może jej pomóc. Operacja, której podjął się specjalista jest bardzo ryzykowna i skomplikowana</desc>

Ma też lekką asymetrię lewej części twarzy i problemy ze wzrokiem. Wizja powikłań sprawiła, że uciekała przed decyzją o operacji przez kilka lat. Próbowała leczyć się przy pomocy medycyny naturalnej, a nawet jogi. Od pewnego czasu guz zaczął jednak rosnąć w zastraszającym tempie, co zmusiło Olgę do podjęcia decyzji o leczeniu. Uwierzyła, że dr Głowacki ze Szpitala Zachodniego w Grodzisku Mazowieckim może jej pomóc. Operacja, której podjął się specjalista jest bardzo ryzykowna i skomplikowana(n)</desc>

Helen uderzyła szkoleniowca, gdyż dyskryminował jej córkę, nie pozwalając ośmiolatce grać w pierwszym składzie zespołu. Zamiast niej wystawiał swoje dziecko. Sprawa wydaje się przesądzona, gdyż wina Helen jest bezsprzeczna. Jane postanawia jednak wykorzystać przed sądem pewne informacje o Bryancie, które zdobyła jeszcze jako Deb. Wkrótce Teri wzywa Bingum na posterunek policji. Razem z kuzynem Edwardem została bowiem aresztowana za zakłócanie porządku publicznego. Sprawa jest jednak poważniejsza, gdyż Edwardowi grozi deportacja do Korei Płd. Mężczyzna jest w szoku, gdyż całe życie spędził w USA. Jedyną szansą, by go ocalić jest wyjawienie mu rodzinnej tajemnicy związanej z jego urodzeniem. Tony dostaje awans. W związku z tym musi przeprowadzić się do Waszyngtonu. Bingum zastanawia się, czy wyjechać razem z nim(n)</desc>

Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Harvey Gets A Song Stuck.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Funella has written the beginning to a new song to welcome guests into the Furchester Hotel. It's very very catchy. So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!.</desc>

Trixie and Olly dress up in clothes from that time and together they find out about a boy called Francis Drake, who became a famous sailor when he grew up. Trixie and Olly try out the types of food that sailors would have eaten, including some very hard ship's biscuits! Then, they discover why sailors had to be good at sewing. Together they visit a big ship just like the one Francis went on and find out all about the sorts of jobs a ship's boy had to do. Finally, they go looking for treasure!.</desc>
