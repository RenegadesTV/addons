    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

Twelve-year-old Chloe leads a lonely existence - her mother is too busy with her political ambitions to take any interest in her daughter, her hen-pecked dad is hiding a secret of his own and she cannot hope to compete with her `perfect' younger sister - to say nothing of the nasty girls who make her school life a misery.
