Robby Muller's cinematography won critics awards and the film garnered Independent Spirit Award nominations for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Farmer)</desc>

It doesn't matter that the parishioner has confessed to killing a person in self-defense: Father Barnes is bound by the rules of his order, and remains mum. The situation gets worse when another person is accused of the killing, at which point Jessica Fletcher, bound by no rules other than her own, decides to intervene. This episode marks the first of several series appearances by Madlyn Rhue, an actress who had been forced into virtual retirement by multiple sclerosis, but who was able to pay her medical bills by occasionally appearing on Murder She Wrote through the auspices of her friend Angela Lansbury</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Romantic Improvisations. It has been five months since the wedding of Paul and Jamie Buchman (Paul Reiser, Helen Hunt) -- and five whole days since Paul and Jamie have been alone long enough to do what married couples do in privacy. Their plans to spend an evening by themselves lead to a hilarious misunderstanding when each assumes the other has canceled a dinner engagement. This premiere episode of Mad About You serves to introduce not only the Buchmans, but also their friends Mark and Fran Devanow (Richard Kind, Leila Kenzle), Lisa Stemple (Anne Ramsay), and Jay Selby (Tommy Hinkley) -- not to mention Murray the dog</desc>

Confused by the myriad of choices (tea-dipped Irish linen or antique?), and by the very thought of having to actually make a choice, Paul practically goes into shock. And besides, a couch is a couch, even if someone else calls it a divan...or a sofa...or...</desc>

The beautiful Queen Ravenna is an evil sorceress who seized the throne by killing the widowed King Magnus on their wedding night. Ravenna's astonishing looks are maintained solely at a terrible cost to the realm's maidens; and when she discovers the beating heart of her long-imprisoned stepdaughter Snow White will grant her eternal pulchritude, the princess's days are numbered. But Snow White is now a strong, capable young woman, and she flees to the near-impenetrable Dark Forest, where Ravenna's black arts are impotent. So the queen dispatches The Huntsman to bring Snow White to her fate. However, he switches allegiance and joins forces with Snow White, Prince William and eight dwarves to set out to end Ravenna's cruel reign. But there will be bloody battles and much potent magic to overcome before that is possible..</desc>

    <title lang="en">Date Night</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Double Take</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man trying to run away from trouble finds it follows him in unexpected ways in this action-packed vehicle for comic actors Eddie Griffin and Orlando Jones. Daryl Chase (Jones) is a successful investment banker who handles international accounts for a major New York firm. Chase discovers to his surprise that one of his biggest clients, a company from Mexico, is actually a front for a cartel of drug smugglers; Chase realizes too late that he's been framed for money laundering, and is now wanted by the FBI. Chase is soon approached by a CIA agent, who thinks Chase's relationship with the Mexican drug kingpins might prove useful, but when his local contact disappears, Chase has to make his way to Mexico in order to save his skin and hopefully clear his name. Needing a new identity to get out of town and across the border, Chase obtains a stolen passport -- and soon learns the man whose name he's using is in even deeper trouble with the law than himself. With nowhere else to turn, Chase asks streetwise hustler Freddie Tiffany (Griffin) to help him get out of town; Chase will pretend to be Freddie, while Tiffany will pose as a businessman like Chase. However, Chase finds out Tiffany isn't the man he thought he was, and that his sticky situation is even more perilous and fraught with secrets than he imagined. Double Take was inspired by the 1957 drama Across The Bridge, which was in turn based on a novel by Graham Greene; the supporting cast includes Edward Herrmann, Gary Grubbs, Garcelle Beauvais, and Daniel Roebuck</desc>

Leaving aside her sparky working relationship with cameraman Pete, it all looks close to perfect to the outsider. But things take an abrupt about turn when she's sent to interview Prophet Jack, a sidewalk savant feted for his ability to predict football scores. He dutifully predicts the next day's results for her, as well as unseasonal weather, along with the unwelcome, unsettling news that she will die in a week's time. So far, so dismissible - until the scores come in, together with an unexpected hail storm, leaving Lanie with some serious thinking to do about what she wants from (her apparently foreshortened) life and her relationships..</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Crash Reel</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kevin Pearce was an American snowboarder who became a star in the world of extreme sports, and an athlete who lived for the adrenaline rush of catching air on the half-pipe. Pearce seemed a sure bet to make the 2010 Winter Olympic team, but that all changed in 2009, when during training exercises in Park City, Utah, he miscalculated and suffered an accident that left him with a traumatic brain injury. Pearce had always been close to his family, and they rallied to his side as he went through grueling rehabilitation while recovering from his injuries. But when Pearce made it clear one of his first priorities was to get back on the half-pipe and someday return to competition, he discovered his loved ones were united against him, not wanting to see him suffer another accident that could be even more costly. Filmmaker Lucy Walker tells the story of Kevin Pearce and his long road to recovery, and also explores the dangers of a popular but very risky sport, in the documentary The Crash Reel. The film received its world premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Transporter</title>
    <desc lang="en">An outlaw finds his life becoming all the more dangerous when he turns against a gang of criminals in this action drama. Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former Special Forces officer who lives on the French Mediterranean and has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. Martin will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street (Matt Schulze), but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai (Shu Qi), who is bound and gagged. Lai briefly escapes, but Martin captures her, and delivers her to Wall Street as promised. However, after being given a parcel to deliver by Wall Street, Martin finds out what Wall Street is up to - in partnership with Lai's father Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), Wall Street is part of a scheme to smuggle Asian illegal aliens into France. Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi (Francois Berleand) has gotten wind of his illegal business. The Transporter was the first English-language feature for Hong Kong-based director Corey Yuen, who along with directing a number of HK action flicks designed fight choreography for several American films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the popular cartoon character, this family-oriented "ghost story" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl (Christina Ricci). The eternally irritable Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in New England. Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hopelessly stranded on the remote shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers hatch a plan to get back to Central Park that instead finds them soaking up sun in the picturesque plains of Africa. Madagascar may be a nice place to visit, but for the gang of animals who spent most of their lives in New York, there is truly no place like home. After discovering the remnants of a crashed airplane, the penguins quickly set about making the repairs needed to get the craft airborne again. When the plane finally takes to the sky, it begins to look like it's only a matter of time before Alex the Lion (voice of Ben Stiller) and friends are soaring over New York Harbor. Unfortunately the penguins weren't the aviation experts they claimed to be, and before long the crew is coming in for a crash-landing in the untamed plains of Africa. Now, as the animals reared in the safety of the zoo come into contact with their decidedly wild counterparts for the very first time, they get a better feel for their roots while marveling over the differences between life in the concrete jungle and life on the world's second largest continent. Of course, while there's plenty to love about wandering the open plains, romantic rivalries and the risk of running into dangerous poachers soon begin to outweigh the joys of some long-overdue family reunions. With some particularly heavy cases of homesickness causing hearts to weigh heavy, the group gradually starts to wonder whether they'll ever find their way back home. Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andy Richter lend their voices to this animated sequel that re-teams original Madagascar co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Shepherd</title>
    <desc lang="en">One man bears witness to the secret history of America during the Cold War in this drama directed by celebrated actor Robert De Niro. In 1939, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a young man with a bright future ahead of him -- he's a top student at Yale and the protégé of one of the school's leading English professors, Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon). But Wilson's life changes dramatically when he's invited to join Yale's powerful secret society, Skull and Bones. Through his Skull and Bones connections, Wilson meets Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin), an mysterious FBI agent who asks Wilson to investigate charges that Fredericks is a Nazi sympathizer working with the German government. Later, at a Skull and Bones party, Wilson is introduced to Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie), the sister of one of his classmates and the daughter of a powerful politician; their one-night stand leaves Clover pregnant, and Wilson must leave the woman he loves, Laura (Tammy Blanchard), to wed Clover and give their child a name. Shortly after their wedding, thanks to his work with Murach, Wilson is invited to join the Office of Strategic Services, a military intelligence organization organized by Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro), and Wilson accepts. Through World War II, Wilson serves with the OSS, and learns he can trust no one in the game of international espionage, which helps make him little more than a stranger to his wife, his son, and his few friends. As the OSS evolves into the Central Intelligence Agency after the war, Wilson becomes party to America's darkest and most dangerous secrets, and in the wake of the futile Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Wilson is forced to make a terrible choice between the security of his nation and the safety of his family. Inspired by the true-life story of CIA founder James J. Angleton, The Good Shepherd boasts an impressive supporting cast, including William Hurt, John Turturro, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, and Timothy Hutton(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends</desc>

    <title lang="en">CBBC @ The Ten Pieces Prom</title>
    <desc lang="en">Transferring the magical world of the BBC Ten Pieces cinema film into an exciting and immersive Prom at the Royal Albert Hall, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and conductor Thomas Sondergard are joined by firebirds and fast cars, magic mountains and mountain trolls, stormy seas and wicked witches, as they take the family audience on a journey through ten pieces of classical music. Presenters including Blue Peter's Barney Harwood, Dick and Dom, and Friday Download's Molly Rainford introduce Mozart's Horn Concerto, Mussorgsky's Night on a Bare Mountain and John Adams' Short Ride in a Fast Machine, the dancers of Trinity Laban perform Anna Meredith's striking body percussion piece Connect It and a massed children's choir of 450 sing Handel's Zadok The Priest. The creativity of the nation's children takes centre stage, as their extraordinary artwork and performances in response to the pieces are showcased on big screens and the lucky few perform live on stage with their own dances and compositions. With a lively soundtrack, all-round action, audience participation, a few surprises and a lot of fun along the way, this is the fitting culmination to the first year of the BBC's biggest ever music education initiative, one which has already engaged half of all the primary schools in the country.(n)</desc>
