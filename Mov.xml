Maślana sens życia widzi w posiadaniu, a pieniądze zamierza zdobywać wszelkimi możliwymi sposobami. Anusiak jest synem działacza związkowego i kieruje się prostymi zasadami. Czesio został szczególnie doświadczony przez los. Umarł i teraz powrócił jako zombi. To co łączy tak odmienne osobowości to chęć objęcia władzy nad światem. Każdy ma inny pomysł na to jak ją zdobyć. Na drodze do spełnienia swoich marzeń bohaterowie napotykają na rozmaite przeszkody. Ich głównym źródłem są dorośli. Najwięcej kłopotów sprawia im nauczycielka, pani Frał. Jest starą panną i chciałaby, żeby wszystkie dzieci były grzeczne, ładne i uśmiechnięte. W szkole chłopcy mają sprzymierzeńca w osobie szkolnej higienistki. Ta bardzo nieszczęśliwa wdowa kocha wszystkie dzieci na świecie.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Nazywam się Anusiak</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Opowieść o grupie ośmiolatków z klasy II B. Każdy z chłopców jest zupełnie inny. Konieczko to typ intelektualisty, który swoją przyszłość wiąże z karierą naukową. Maślana sens życia widzi w posiadaniu, a pieniądze zamierza zdobywać wszelkimi możliwymi sposobami. Anusiak jest synem działacza związkowego i kieruje się prostymi zasadami. Czesio został szczególnie doświadczony przez los. Umarł i teraz powrócił jako zombi. To co łączy tak odmienne osobowości to chęć objęcia władzy nad światem. Każdy ma inny pomysł na to jak ją zdobyć. Na drodze do spełnienia swoich marzeń bohaterowie napotykają na rozmaite przeszkody. Ich głównym źródłem są dorośli. Najwięcej kłopotów sprawia im nauczycielka, pani Frał. Jest starą panną i chciałaby, żeby wszystkie dzieci były grzeczne, ładne i uśmiechnięte. W szkole chłopcy mają sprzymierzeńca w osobie szkolnej higienistki. Ta bardzo nieszczęśliwa wdowa kocha wszystkie dzieci na świecie.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">YolanDa kicks off the show with 'Bass Face', a song all about pitch, and the guests are tuba stars Theon Cross and Oren Marshall. They bring a traditional tuba alongside a customised one, ?The Orenophone'. In the Fact Jam, we find out how long a tuba would be when stretched out, and that the biggest tuba in the world is three times the size of a normal one. A short film features two football-loving children as they write a football-themed song with the help of Nigel Clark. A funky song starring the tuba called 'Dinosaur Dance' follows.(n)</desc>
