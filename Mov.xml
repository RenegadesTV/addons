    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. W tym odcinku Rachel odkrywa bliskie związki Londynu ze Wschodem, który doskonale odzwierciedla małżeństwo jej mamy rodowitej Austriaczki i pochodzącego z Melanezji taty. Razem z przyjaciółmi zamawia danie na wynos chińskie Dim Sum. Następnie we wschodnim Londynie Rachel pod okiem miejscowego szefa kuchni zgłębia tajniki egzotycznych dań, by później już we własnej kuchni przygotować orientalnego kurczaka z malezyjską sałatką i bułeczkami na parze</desc>

Dostała się na studia dziennikarstwa, dostała również stypendium. Nie odnalazła się jednak zupełnie w środowisku studenckim, nie miała koleżanek, czuła się samotna w związku z czym porzuciła studia. Helena ma trudności ze znalezieniem dla siebie miejsca i zajęcia. Jak sama mówi, to przez to, że się nie uśmiecha. Uważa też, że koleżanki z pracy zazdroszczą jej tego, że jest atrakcyjna. Dziewczyna czuje, że nigdzie nie pasuje, a wszyscy ją odtrącają</desc>

Sprawa wydaje się banalnie prosta, dopóki nie wychodzi na jaw, że kobieta jest recydywistką.

Mężczyzna pragnie oddać swoje serce siostrze Tinie, która pilnie potrzebuje przeszczepu, jednak kobieta odrzuca ten dar.

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia. Na zakończenie przypomni miłośnikom gotowania przepis na tradycyjny brytyjski pudding</desc>

Helena ma trudności ze znalezieniem dla siebie miejsca i zajęcia. Jak sama mówi, to przez to, że się nie uśmiecha. Uważa też, że koleżanki z pracy zazdroszczą jej tego, że jest atrakcyjna.

    <desc lang="pl">Bezkompromisowy i cyniczny kapitan Fred Cain (Bruno Debrandt) pracuje w wydziale zabójstw. Przed pięcioma laty uległ tragicznemu wypadkowi. Od tej pory porusza się na wózku inwalidzkim. Śledczy znany jest z nietypowych metod działania. Niezwykła intuicja sprawia, że z łatwością odgaduje słabości innych. Niekiedy też zdarza się mu łamać obowiązujące procedury. Jego zawodową partnerką jest detektyw Lucie Delambre (Julie Delarme). W życiu prywatnym Caine próbuje uporać się z rozwodem. Kłopotów przysparza mu również dorastający syn, Ben (Davy Sanna)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia. Na zakończenie przypomni miłośnikom gotowania przepis na tradycyjny brytyjski pudding</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Formacja Chatelet</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">W programie wystąpią najlepsi w kraju specjaliści od rozśmieszania publiczności. Na ekranie znane wszystkim Polakom grupy kabaretowe, m.in. Formacja Chatelet, Łowcy.B, Koń Polski, Kabaret pod Wyrwigroszem, Elita, Kabaret Skeczów Męczących i grupa Nowaki. Pojawią się liczni goście specjalni, a także sceniczne osobowości, takie jak Krzysztof Piasecki, Tomasz Jachimek, Jerzy Kryszak, Katarzyna Pakosińska czy Andrzej Grabowski. Spektakl kabaretowy "Wojna płci" umiejętnie balansuje na granicy kabaretu i rzeczywistości. Skecz rozśmieszy każdego, ukazując w humorystyczny sposób doświadczenia damsko-męskie</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>
