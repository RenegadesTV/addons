W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Lekarka potrzebuje męskiego ramienia, by się wypłakać, lecz niestety nie ma co liczyć na ginekologa Kaana. Może mieć tylko nadzieję, że doktor odejdzie dla niej od żony. Jakby kłopotów było mało przyjaciółka Haase zapada na raka i nie zgadza się na leczenie. W życiu lekarki pojawia się też zamożny Alexis von Buren, który jest nią wyraźnie zainteresowany. Podczas oglądania paczka chusteczek i pudełko czekoladek są wskazane, gdyż zapowiada się naprawdę wzruszający odcinek</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Bohaterką odcinka jest 34-letnia Małgosia z Bładnic Dolnych, niewielkiej miejscowości koło Skoczowa. Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

Jej rozmiar powiększył się z 34 na 42.Praca, wychowanie dziecka i prowadzenie domu powodują, że Paulina nie ma czasu i sił, aby zająć się sobą. We własnej skórze czuje się tak źle, że wycofała się nawet z życia towarzyskiego. Marzy, aby znów stać się taka jak dawniej - przebojowa, towarzyska i pełną energii. Widzowie przekonają się, czy uda jej się osiągnąć ten cel i czy problemy z figurą, to jedyny powód zmartwień w życiu Pauliny</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Każdy rodzic wie, że czekolada, chipsy czy coca-cola szkodzą dzieciom. Nie znaczy to jednak, że dorośli potrafią odmówić swoim pociechom tych smakołyków. Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Meier łamie serce Gretchen, gdyż nie rezygnuje ze ślubu z pielęgniarką Gabi. Lekarka potrzebuje męskiego ramienia, by się wypłakać, lecz niestety nie ma co liczyć na ginekologa Kaana. Może mieć tylko nadzieję, że doktor odejdzie dla niej od żony. Jakby kłopotów było mało przyjaciółka Haase zapada na raka i nie zgadza się na leczenie. W życiu lekarki pojawia się też zamożny Alexis von Buren, który jest nią wyraźnie zainteresowany. Podczas oglądania paczka chusteczek i pudełko czekoladek są wskazane, gdyż zapowiada się naprawdę wzruszający odcinek</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Bohaterką odcinka jest 34-letnia Małgosia z Bładnic Dolnych, niewielkiej miejscowości koło Skoczowa. Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

Jej rozmiar powiększył się z 34 na 42.Praca, wychowanie dziecka i prowadzenie domu powodują, że Paulina nie ma czasu i sił, aby zająć się sobą. We własnej skórze czuje się tak źle, że wycofała się nawet z życia towarzyskiego. Marzy, aby znów stać się taka jak dawniej - przebojowa, towarzyska i pełną energii. Widzowie przekonają się, czy uda jej się osiągnąć ten cel i czy problemy z figurą, to jedyny powód zmartwień w życiu Pauliny</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Każdy rodzic wie, że czekolada, chipsy czy coca-cola szkodzą dzieciom. Nie znaczy to jednak, że dorośli potrafią odmówić swoim pociechom tych smakołyków. Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rank the Prank - pranking Hollywood style! Today our pesky pranksters are Prank 360 (Zhara and Sara) and Gladiators (Hadrian and Luke) who team up with SFX specialists Marc Reichel and Andy Antoine and stunt performer Devon Slack to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. Today teams invade an office building and for unsuspecting targets, it's going to be anything but another... day at the office! It's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's a battle between the head-scratching 'Office Switcheroo' and the super-charged 'Trainwreck Hallway'! Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, Marc, Andy and Devon have planned a MEGA PRANK packed with ninja power! The setting is a martial arts dojo, complete with flying rigs, flying crates and flying people! Will the targets flap their wings and take flight too? One thing's for sure, this MEGA PRANK is gonna be fly!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lauren is completely loved-up and ignoring Millie. Missing her sister's attention, Millie pretends she's had a valentine from her new boyfriend. Instant success - Lauren is all ears and all over her! Now Millie has to keep up the pretence, which turns out not to be as easy as she thought. Eventually she's cornered, and is forced to invite the made-up Grant round to tea the next day. Naturally enough, the entire family want to meet this wonderful-sounding boy? Craig impresses Fran when he sticks up for Jake - and soon she's got hearts in her eyes too, to Millie and Lauren's horror. Do they need to stage an intervention - or will Craig put her off without their help?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For a new intake of Year 7s, secondary school is a vast world that they need to navigate. This series reflects the highs and lows of it all; but ultimately it shows the CBBC viewer worried about going up to big school, that it will all be OK. In Episode One, as well as meeting some of the year 7s we will get to know throughout the series, we meet newcomer Easa, who not only doesn't speak a word of English, but has never been to school before. Social media can sometimes cause big problems in school but it can also transform the way students learn and communicate. In this episode, we discover what can go wrong when mobile phones are used in the wrong way in class - causing a fall out for some of our year 7s - and we also follow the efforts of Leo, who has ADHD and autism. He is on a mission to use social media in a good way, to let the world know what it feels like to be him. It's a big challenge - will he be able to face his fears and present his video to the whole of year 7?</desc>
