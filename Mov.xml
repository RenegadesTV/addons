Badania wykazały, że chłopak miał napad padaczki spowodowany groźnym naczyniakiem wywierającym nacisk na jego mózg. Zdaniem lekarzy w tym przypadku najskuteczniejszy będzie zabieg przeprowadzany bez rozcinania czaszki pacjenta. Operator dociera specjalnym mikrocewnikiem do naczyniaka i za pomocą kleju odcina go od układu krwionośnego. Ze względu na rozmiar zmiany leczenie przebiega stopniowo, dlatego to już trzecia operacja, której zostanie poddany Michał(n)</desc>

Często krytykuje lewicowych polityków za ich liberalne podejście do tego problemu.
