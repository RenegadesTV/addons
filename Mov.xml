    <desc lang="en">Can you transfer what's in your imagination onto a page? If you can then you could become an illustrator. Rookies Tamira and Kirsty desperately want to do just that.

A trip to the zoo is next to observe how animals move and to observe their expressions. Writer Michael Rosen pops up to give some advice on their work before setting them the task of making their own illustrated books - the end result is amazing.(n)</desc>
