    <title lang="en">Harry Potter: A History of Magic</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary exploring the myths, traditions and everyday artefacts that inspired JK Rowling as she crafted the wizarding world depicted in her celebrated Harry Potter series. The British Library is marking the 20th anniversary of the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with an exhibition showcasing unseen manuscripts, drawings, drafts and personal items from Rowling's private archives, and this programme sheds light on how the objects on display helped to fire the author's imagination over the course of the past two decades. Famous fans offer playful readings that recreate some of the best-loved spells, potion recipes and magical moments from the books, and the programme introduces individuals who have made the magic of the novels a reality, from real-life wand-makers to passionate Quidditch enthusiasts. Narrated by Imelda Staunton</desc>
