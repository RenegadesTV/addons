Bob (Dillon) is the leader of a small gang of junkies that robs pharmacies and hospitals for prescription drugs. Alas, Bob is now starting to feel the burden of responsibility as he watches over his band of misfits. Van Sant's joyous and exhilarating second feature is notable for its humor and bravery.</desc>

It's only temporary, until they find a bigger place, but the resulting chaos drives Millie, Lauren, Fran and Jake round to Mum's.

She thinks it'll teach him to be a better brother - but Jake thinks Craig is pretty cool as he is, and starts imitating his teenage ways. Back in the confusion of the crowded flat, Dad's new website is bringing in lots of work, but his Post-It based filing system has a major weakness: gusts of wind.</desc>
