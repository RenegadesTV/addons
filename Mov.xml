    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Étoile filante</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">W operze w Marsylii dochodzi do dziwnego zdarzenia - w trakcie przedstawienia "Romeo i Julia" nagle umiera główny tancerz, Cyril Dubois. Istnieje kilku potencjalnych morderców. Jednym z nich jest Grigorij, który po śmierci Cyrila stanie na czele baletu. Podejrzenia padają również na zazdrosną Noémie, do szaleństwa zakochaną w denacie. Detektywi mają też wątpliwości co do innego baletmistrza, Serge Vassara - mógł on obawiać się konkurencji ze strony święcącego triumfy Cyrila. Prowadzący śledztwo Cain nie może być pewien nawet szczerości brata zmarłego, operowego osteopaty, który zna wszystkie mroczne tajemnice artystów. Tancerze swojej sztuce poświęcają ciało i duszę i mają przy tym świadomość, że nikt nie jest w stanie zagwarantować im sukcesu. Kierowani ambicją poddają się żelaznej dyscyplinie, żyją w zamkniętym świecie i wszystkie swoje siły koncentrują na karierze. Artyści są gotowi na wiele, dlatego nawet Cain nie może czuć się bezpiecznie w operze</desc>

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości. Jej siostra Sarah (Lizzy Caplan) ma odmienne niż ona poglądy na życie. Kobieta w zupełnie inny sposób podchodzi do relacji z płcią przeciwną. Pragnie przede wszystkim niezależności i swobody, dlatego odrzuca nieoczekiwane oświadczyny swojego chłopaka, Kevina (Geoffrey Arend).

Teraz na tej samej trasie ma miejsce z pozoru zwyczajny wypadek motocyklowy. Okazuje się, że ktoś uszkodził hamulce pojazdu, którym jechał Stéphane Lecalm. Śledczy spotykają się z Celine, tajemniczą wdową. Trafiają też do stoczni, gdzie pracował zmarły. Poznają tam Nathalie, młodą kobietę molestowaną przez Lecalma. W sprawę jest zamieszana również Joan Carbonnel, która zdiagnozowała u denata śmiertelną chorobę. Lekarka przewodniczy też "Adrenalinie", stowarzyszeniu sportów ekstremalnych, do którego należał pechowy motocykl. Cain i Lucie podejrzewają, że klub tak naprawdę powstał, by umożliwiać swoim członkom samobójstwo. Jednak Lecalm nie umarł z własnej winy. Według detektywa Celine, Nathalie i Joan stanowią klucz do rozwiązania tej zagadki(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Étoile filante</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">W operze w Marsylii dochodzi do dziwnego zdarzenia - w trakcie przedstawienia "Romeo i Julia" nagle umiera główny tancerz, Cyril Dubois. Istnieje kilku potencjalnych morderców. Jednym z nich jest Grigorij, który po śmierci Cyrila stanie na czele baletu. Podejrzenia padają również na zazdrosną Noémie, do szaleństwa zakochaną w denacie. Detektywi mają też wątpliwości co do innego baletmistrza, Serge Vassara - mógł on obawiać się konkurencji ze strony święcącego triumfy Cyrila. Prowadzący śledztwo Cain nie może być pewien nawet szczerości brata zmarłego, operowego osteopaty, który zna wszystkie mroczne tajemnice artystów. Tancerze swojej sztuce poświęcają ciało i duszę i mają przy tym świadomość, że nikt nie jest w stanie zagwarantować im sukcesu. Kierowani ambicją poddają się żelaznej dyscyplinie, żyją w zamkniętym świecie i wszystkie swoje siły koncentrują na karierze. Artyści są gotowi na wiele, dlatego nawet Cain nie może czuć się bezpiecznie w operze</desc>

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości. Jej siostra Sarah (Lizzy Caplan) ma odmienne niż ona poglądy na życie. Kobieta w zupełnie inny sposób podchodzi do relacji z płcią przeciwną. Pragnie przede wszystkim niezależności i swobody, dlatego odrzuca nieoczekiwane oświadczyny swojego chłopaka, Kevina (Geoffrey Arend). Niedługo po rozstaniu w życiu Sarah pojawia się Jonathan (Mark Webber). Para wdaje się w namiętny romans, a uroczy mężczyzna szybko zdobywa jej serce. Niespodziewane uczucie zmusza ją do zastanowienia się nad swoimi wyborami i podjęcia trudnej decyzji</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Cain został sparaliżowany w wyniku kraksy, do której doszło kilka lat wcześniej na pewnej krętej drodze. Teraz na tej samej trasie ma miejsce z pozoru zwyczajny wypadek motocyklowy. Okazuje się, że ktoś uszkodził hamulce pojazdu, którym jechał Stéphane Lecalm. Śledczy spotykają się z Celine, tajemniczą wdową. Trafiają też do stoczni, gdzie pracował zmarły. Poznają tam Nathalie, młodą kobietę molestowaną przez Lecalma. W sprawę jest zamieszana również Joan Carbonnel, która zdiagnozowała u denata śmiertelną chorobę. Lekarka przewodniczy też "Adrenalinie", stowarzyszeniu sportów ekstremalnych, do którego należał pechowy motocykl. Cain i Lucie podejrzewają, że klub tak naprawdę powstał, by umożliwiać swoim członkom samobójstwo. Jednak Lecalm nie umarł z własnej winy. Według detektywa Celine, Nathalie i Joan stanowią klucz do rozwiązania tej zagadki(n)</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The end of year exams are looming and Maud's annoyed that distracted Mildred isn't taking revision seriously. Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Twirlywoos are beside a river. They watch a fisherman make his rod longer and longer and longer. The fisherman casts out the line and then settles down for a nap. Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line</desc>

Trixie and Olly dress up in clothes from that time and together they find out about a boy called Francis Drake, who became a famous sailor when he grew up. Trixie and Olly try out the types of food that sailors would have eaten, including some very hard ship's biscuits! Then, they discover why sailors had to be good at sewing. Together they visit a big ship just like the one Francis went on and find out all about the sorts of jobs a ship's boy had to do. Finally, they go looking for treasure!</desc>
