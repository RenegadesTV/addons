    <title lang="en">Bloody Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>

It's only temporary, until they find a bigger place, but the resulting chaos drives Millie, Lauren, Fran and Jake round to Mum's. And Millie has an ulterior motive: getting Craig to look after the hyper Jake as revenge for his annoying behaviour. She thinks it'll teach him to be a better brother - but Jake thinks Craig is pretty cool as he is, and starts imitating his teenage ways. Back in the confusion of the crowded flat, Dad's new website is bringing in lots of work, but his Post-It based filing system has a major weakness: gusts of wind.</desc>
