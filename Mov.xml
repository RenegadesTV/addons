    <desc lang="en">The police wake to the news of a robbery, but the full extent of the crime and its haul - £2.6million - only becomes evident over the following days. It's clear the local CID is ill-equipped to solve a case of such magnitude, so Scotland Yard is called in, with a six-strong team of detectives headed by the Flying Squad's enigmatic chief Tommy Butler. In a race against time, they set out to identify every criminal involved and bring them to justice before they flee the country - but even if they can, will they find the money? Jim Broadbent stars in the concluding part of the drama about the most infamous heist in British history, with George Costigan, Robert Glenister, Tim Pigott-Smith, Nick Moran and John Salthouse. Written by Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall.</desc>

Now at his third school, Tom is having trouble settling in and finding acceptance from his newfound peers - except for Trevor, a tough little charmer who also suffers prejudice due to his Aboriginal heritage.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>
