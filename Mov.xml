Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Everyone is excited to learn that the annual Spelling Bee final will be between Cackle's and Pentangle's, with the exceptions of Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Out of Bounds</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The end of year exams are looming and Maud's annoyed that distracted Mildred isn't taking revision seriously. Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Funella has written the beginning to a new song to welcome guests into the Furchester Hotel. It's very very catchy. So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Posting a Letter and Colouring Pencils</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">In today's episode, Maddie is sending a letter in the post to the CBeebies house. She finds out how posting a letter works as she follows the letter's journey from the post box to the sorting office and finally to the house. Using a special infrared light, Maddie shows us how stamps are scanned to tell if they are first or second class. Next, she visits a factory where colouring pencils are made. She finds out how the coloured crayon inside is made from clay and, using her slow-motion camera, we see the wooden shaft of the pencil being made.</desc>

Outside in the sweltering heat, Simon turns on the sprinkler to help everyone cool down, but poor Waffle doesn't like the sprinkler and darts through the hole in the fence to Mrs Hobbs's garden, looking for shade.

Maybe that will encourage him back?</desc>

She shows us how the surface tension of water changes when we add soap and how we can stop bubbles from bursting with our hands, and using her slow-motion camera, she shows how bubbles make a sphere shape. Next, Maddie heads to a factory where a party favourite is made - chocolate! We learn how chocolate starts out as a fruit, and we see the chocolates being made for an assortment box. Maddie also uses her special camera to see the super-fast robots that put the different chocolates into the right holes in their boxes.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Horsetail Fall, California</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Go Jetters have travelled to Horsetail Fall in the Yosemite National Park. It's a 300m-high waterfall made of melted snow. Once a year the setting sun lights up the water, making it glow like fire for just a few special minutes. This is called Firefall, and if there isn't enough water from the melting snow, Firefall doesn't happen. Unfortunately, Grandmaster Glitch has built a snow princess at the top of the fall and is using an ice machine to stop her melting. When the Go Jetters arrive to watch Firefall, they see that there is no water falling down! Can the team save snowy Princess Glorinda and Firefall?(n)</desc>
