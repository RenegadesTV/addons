    <desc lang="en">For a new intake of Year 7s, secondary school is a vast world that they need to navigate. This series reflects the highs and lows of it all; but ultimately it shows the CBBC viewer worried about going up to big school, that it will all be OK. In Episode One, as well as meeting some of the year 7s we will get to know throughout the series, we meet newcomer Easa, who not only doesn't speak a word of English, but has never been to school before. Social media can sometimes cause big problems in school but it can also transform the way students learn and communicate. In this episode, we discover what can go wrong when mobile phones are used in the wrong way in class - causing a fall out for some of our year 7s - and we also follow the efforts of Leo, who has ADHD and autism. He is on a mission to use social media in a good way, to let the world know what it feels like to be him. It's a big challenge - will he be able to face his fears and present his video to the whole of year 7?(n).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this episode we follow Debbie as she takes her first ever train ride to York to visit the Railway Museum. Debbie's family travels to the local station to catch the train. But first they must buy a ticket and find the right platform. On board the conductor checks their tickets and lets them know which stop they need to get off at. When they arrive in York they visit a museum all about how trains work and Debbie sees lots of different colours, styles and shapes of trains. Join Debbie and her family on their special trip to York and find out if she gets to ride on a real-life steam train!(n).(n)</desc>
