    <desc lang="pl">Jane jedzie z Graysonem do Stratford na uroczysty wykład na swojej dawnej uczelni. Poznają tam studentkę prawa Veronikę Kramer, która jako wolontariuszka pomaga w sądzie Alison Thomas - biednej kobiecie walczącej z pracodawcą. Gdy klientka przyszłej prawniczki niespodziewanie zostaje aresztowana pod zarzutem znęcania się nad swoim dzieckiem, Jane i Grayston decydują jej bronić. Alison miała w pracy stały kontakt z metanolem, który wraz z jej mlekiem najwyraźniej przedostał się do organizmu jej synka. Niemowlę przez to zachorowało, więc kobieta pozwała firmę EastBay o odszkodowanie w celu zdobycia funduszy na jego leczenie. Tymczasem Parker prosi Kim, by pomogła ich nowej wspólniczce Ginie bronić Marty'ego Sadlera. Został on pozwany o odszkodowanie przez mężczyznę potrąconego na przejściu dla pieszych przez jedną z ciężarówek należących do jego firmy kurierskiej.

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości. Jej siostra Sarah (Lizzy Caplan) ma odmienne niż ona poglądy na życie. Kobieta w zupełnie inny sposób podchodzi do relacji z płcią przeciwną.

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Our aspiring young aircrew get their first opportunity to actually fly a plane as they are catapulted into the skies high above the peak district in a glider. They then head for Manchester to meet an airline pilot who shows them just what is needed to fly a passenger jet and lets them fly a professional simulator as used to train real pilots! Finally what they have always dreamed of happens - they take to the skies in a small aircraft with mentor Tony who puts them through their paces handling a twin engine plane. And then they get to fly it themselves, actually taking control of the plane high above the ground! Impressive!(n)</desc>

Our aspiring young aircrew get their first opportunity to actually fly a plane as they are catapulted into the skies high above the peak district in a glider. They then head for Manchester to meet an airline pilot who shows them just what is needed to fly a passenger jet and lets them fly a professional simulator as used to train real pilots! Finally what they have always dreamed of happens - they take to the skies in a small aircraft with mentor Tony who puts them through their paces handling a twin engine plane. And then they get to fly it themselves, actually taking control of the plane high above the ground! Impressive!(n)</desc>

Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her(n)</desc>
