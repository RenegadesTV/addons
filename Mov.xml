    <title lang="en">Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth</title>
    <desc lang="en">This wacky satire of teen horror spoofs every convention of its vapid genre with broadly funny style, following the efforts of a high school principal (Coolio) and a TV reporter (Tiffani Amber Thiessen) to uncover the truth about a series of slayings on campus. Tom Arnold, Shirley Jones and Jimmie Walker costar in this delightfully absurd lampoon</desc>

But for a homeless father (Jeff Bridges) and his teenage son (Edward Furlong), it's a cold, hard fact of life.

With this eye-opening drama, he looks at this avoidable human catastrophe from a somewhat different perspective. Featuring music by Tom Waits</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lou Rawls guest stars in an episode that takes a lighthearted look at a serious problem: colon cancer. Rawls appears as a singing doctor in a sequence in which Michael “previews” his colonoscopy the night before he has it. Getting him there is not easy. “What is it with men?” Janet fumes. “You take better care of your cars than you do of your bodies.” That doesn't make him bend. What does is the thought of not being there for his kids. (repeat)</desc>

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej.

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Po tym, jak w akcie obrony zabiła swojego ówczesnego kochanka, została objęta programem ochrony świadków i teraz wiedzie szczęśliwe życie u boku nowo poślubionego męża.

Pewnego dnia Erin znajduje na swoim progu martwego kosa, a wkrótce potem zostaje oskarżona o zamordowanie opiekującego się nią agenta. Bliscy nie wierzą w niewinność kobiety, jedynie oficer Marina Delgado (Venus Terzo), partnerka zmarłego funkcjonariusza FBI, decyduje się zweryfikować jej wersję wydarzeń</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">W przeszłości Erin (Mia Kirshner) spotykała się z gangsterem. Po tym, jak w akcie obrony zabiła swojego ówczesnego kochanka, została objęta programem ochrony świadków i teraz wiedzie szczęśliwe życie u boku nowo poślubionego męża. Sielanka kończy się, gdy przyjaciółka Erin przedstawia jej swojego chłopaka, Warrena (Paul McGillion), który niepokojąco przypomina dawnego ukochanego kobiety. Pewnego dnia Erin znajduje na swoim progu martwego kosa, a wkrótce potem zostaje oskarżona o zamordowanie opiekującego się nią agenta. Bliscy nie wierzą w niewinność kobiety, jedynie oficer Marina Delgado (Venus Terzo), partnerka zmarłego funkcjonariusza FBI, decyduje się zweryfikować jej wersję wydarzeń</desc>
