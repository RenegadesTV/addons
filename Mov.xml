W planie dnia upokorzenie ze strony chorego na raka pacjenta i rozmowa z matką o jej dużo młodszym partnerze o artystycznej duszy. Informacja o zostaniu druhną wyprowadza Gretchen z równowagi na tyle, że lekarka znów zapomina o diecie. Nadchodzi czas na lunch, ciastko i kawę, a zaraz po nich drugi lunch. Po tych wszystkich rewelacjach Haase nie ma siły pocieszać doktora Kaana, który poznał nieciekawe fakty z życia swojej żony. Lekarka rezygnuje więc z kolacji</desc>

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki. Sukces nie zagłusza w niej chęci poznania odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy seks pod prysznicem jest wygodny. Chciałaby rozwiać swoje wątpliwości w tej kwestii</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania.

    <desc lang="pl">42-letnia Agnieszka jest optykiem i mieszka w Warszawie. Głównym jej problemem jest brak wiary w siebie. Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania. Eksperci spróbują jej pomóc uwierzyć w siebie i przywrócić nadzieję, że wszystko ułoży się po jej myśli</desc>

Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki.

Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia. W jej życiu pojawia się bogacz, który ma ochotę na bliższą znajomość. Będzie się działo!</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

W tym czasie Danni rozpaczliwie próbuje utrzymać dietę, by w dniu ślubu zachwycić gości. Niestety problemy z wieczorem panieńskim sprawiają, że trudno jej oprzeć się słodkościom.

Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>

W planie dnia upokorzenie ze strony chorego na raka pacjenta i rozmowa z matką o jej dużo młodszym partnerze o artystycznej duszy. Informacja o zostaniu druhną wyprowadza Gretchen z równowagi na tyle, że lekarka znów zapomina o diecie. Nadchodzi czas na lunch, ciastko i kawę, a zaraz po nich drugi lunch. Po tych wszystkich rewelacjach Haase nie ma siły pocieszać doktora Kaana, który poznał nieciekawe fakty z życia swojej żony. Lekarka rezygnuje więc z kolacji</desc>

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki. Sukces nie zagłusza w niej chęci poznania odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy seks pod prysznicem jest wygodny. Chciałaby rozwiać swoje wątpliwości w tej kwestii</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania.

    <desc lang="pl">42-letnia Agnieszka jest optykiem i mieszka w Warszawie. Głównym jej problemem jest brak wiary w siebie. Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania. Eksperci spróbują jej pomóc uwierzyć w siebie i przywrócić nadzieję, że wszystko ułoży się po jej myśli</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Bohaterką odcinka jest 34-letnia Małgosia z Bładnic Dolnych, niewielkiej miejscowości koło Skoczowa. Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki. Sukces nie zagłusza w niej chęci poznania odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy seks pod prysznicem jest wygodny. Chciałaby rozwiać swoje wątpliwości w tej kwestii</desc>

Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia. W jej życiu pojawia się bogacz, który ma ochotę na bliższą znajomość. Będzie się działo!</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

W tym czasie Danni rozpaczliwie próbuje utrzymać dietę, by w dniu ślubu zachwycić gości. Niestety problemy z wieczorem panieńskim sprawiają, że trudno jej oprzeć się słodkościom.

Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>

    <title lang="en">Little Roy</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Oh Brother!.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Roy wishes he had a cartoon, little brother who wants to play all the time. Not a big sister who gets mad at him. Nodding off, a dream bubble above his head shows Roy playing with Zip-a little, cartoon brother. When Roy wakes up, he is thrilled to find that Zip has hopped out of his dream and into reality. But things don't quite go according to plan! Roy steps out of his room to find an upturned laundry basket on the landing and clothes everywhere! In the kitchen, Zip wolfs down a cake, and out in the garden he creates a grass whirlwind over Bill's newly mowed lawn. While Roy cleans up Zip's mess with a rake, he tells Tristan all about his cartoon brother who escaped from his dream and is causing havoc. Roy realises that having a cartoon brother who wants to play all the time, might not always be such fun. Roy knows they have to get Zip back to Dreamland and wonders - What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, The Messer is wreaking havoc, until Wonder Roy puts a halt to his shenanigans by bringing in The Messer's mother, wisely working out that everyone gets homesick. Back in reality, Tristan and Roy work together to show Zip what he's missing in Dreamland? endless cakes and endless fun! Zip leaps onto Roy's bed and bounces into the dream bubble. Lesson learned, Roy tidies the bedroom for Becky. He finishes, just in the nick of time, as Becky arrives home with some cake to share with her favourite, little cartoon brother</desc>

Today our pesky pranksters Koala Bunnies (Svetlana and Neptune) and Prank Bosses (James and Caiden) join forces with prosthetics and make-up wiz CJ Goldman and SFX guru Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. Teams summon wizards and aliens on a busy city street corner and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life! But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? Get ready for some gut-busting reactions when Svetlana and Neptune's 'Blizzard-ade' faces off with James and Caiden's 'Alien Crash Landing'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. And for the winning team, CJ and Andy have planned the ultimate mega prank with the wackiest obstacle course challenge ever created! Exploding cakes, spraying cream and a crazed clown aren't the only obstacles to avoid on this course. If the 'target' is going to make it through, he'll have to dodge a grizzly bear too! It's one huge bear and one hilarious MEGA PRANK!</desc>
