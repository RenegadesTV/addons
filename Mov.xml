Istotne jest jak najszybsze postawienie diagnozy i wdrożenie właściwej terapii. Rodzice Mai są tego świadomi, ponieważ ich starsza córka Wiktoria również cierpi na niedosłuch. Najlepszym możliwym rozwiązaniem poprawiającym efektywność słuchu okazało się wszczepienie implantu ślimakowego. Nadchodzi długo wyczekiwany termin zabiegu. Cała rodzina zjawia się w szpitalu. W trakcie operacji Mai lekarz stwierdza, że jest to ekstremalnie trudny przypadek. Widzowie zobaczą, czy zabieg zakończy się sukcesem</desc>

Mąż Olivii, Bryan porzucił ją, gdy stał się bardzo bogaty. Przed ślubem podpisali intercyzę, więc po oficjalnym rozstaniu siostra Owena może liczyć jedynie na ułamek majątku. Olivia wyznaje, że właściwie nie chce rozwodu, ale czuje się głęboko zraniona, bo Bryan zdradza ją z komputerową aplikacją o wyglądzie blond piękności. Kim musi udowodnić w sądzie, że mężczyzna żyje w wirtualnej rzeczywistości. Z kolei klientką Jane zostaje Rita Curtis, była pracownica supermarketu, która uważa, że została bezpodstawnie zwolniona. Prawniczka czuje, że łączy ją z tą kobietą znacznie więcej, niż mogłoby się wydawać na pierwszy rzut oka. Tymczasem Grayston pracuje nad umową spółki Stacy i Nikki. Odkrywa, że LePree nie jest osobą, za którą się podaje. Jane nie chce, by jej przyjaciółka powierzyła oszustce oszczędności swojego życia</desc>

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

Zdaniem lekarzy w tym przypadku najskuteczniejszy będzie zabieg przeprowadzany bez rozcinania czaszki pacjenta. Operator dociera specjalnym mikrocewnikiem do naczyniaka i za pomocą kleju odcina go od układu krwionośnego. Ze względu na rozmiar zmiany leczenie przebiega stopniowo, dlatego to już trzecia operacja, której zostanie poddany Michał</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">21-letni Michał z Radomia zasłabł nagle w trakcie podróży warszawskim metrem. Badania wykazały, że chłopak miał napad padaczki spowodowany groźnym naczyniakiem wywierającym nacisk na jego mózg. Zdaniem lekarzy w tym przypadku najskuteczniejszy będzie zabieg przeprowadzany bez rozcinania czaszki pacjenta. Operator dociera specjalnym mikrocewnikiem do naczyniaka i za pomocą kleju odcina go od układu krwionośnego. Ze względu na rozmiar zmiany leczenie przebiega stopniowo, dlatego to już trzecia operacja, której zostanie poddany Michał</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">4-letnia Maja urodziła się z częściową głuchotą, co utrudnia jej właściwe rozumienie mowy i sprawia poważne problemy w nabywaniu umiejętności językowych oraz komunikowaniu się z otoczeniem. Istotne jest jak najszybsze postawienie diagnozy i wdrożenie właściwej terapii. Rodzice Mai są tego świadomi, ponieważ ich starsza córka Wiktoria również cierpi na niedosłuch. Najlepszym możliwym rozwiązaniem poprawiającym efektywność słuchu okazało się wszczepienie implantu ślimakowego. Nadchodzi długo wyczekiwany termin zabiegu. Cała rodzina zjawia się w szpitalu. W trakcie operacji Mai lekarz stwierdza, że jest to ekstremalnie trudny przypadek. Widzowie zobaczą, czy zabieg zakończy się sukcesem</desc>

Mąż Olivii, Bryan porzucił ją, gdy stał się bardzo bogaty. Przed ślubem podpisali intercyzę, więc po oficjalnym rozstaniu siostra Owena może liczyć jedynie na ułamek majątku. Olivia wyznaje, że właściwie nie chce rozwodu, ale czuje się głęboko zraniona, bo Bryan zdradza ją z komputerową aplikacją o wyglądzie blond piękności. Kim musi udowodnić w sądzie, że mężczyzna żyje w wirtualnej rzeczywistości. Z kolei klientką Jane zostaje Rita Curtis, była pracownica supermarketu, która uważa, że została bezpodstawnie zwolniona. Prawniczka czuje, że łączy ją z tą kobietą znacznie więcej, niż mogłoby się wydawać na pierwszy rzut oka. Tymczasem Grayston pracuje nad umową spółki Stacy i Nikki. Odkrywa, że LePree nie jest osobą, za którą się podaje. Jane nie chce, by jej przyjaciółka powierzyła oszustce oszczędności swojego życia</desc>

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Profesor Camus zostaje napadnięty w miejscu wykopalisk archeologicznych, które prowadził w nocy. Tuż przed śmiercią zdążył jeszcze wyszeptać detektywowi jedno słowo - imię Ornella, które naukowiec nadał znalezionemu posągowi. W toku śledztwa Cain i Lucie odkrywają, że pod tym imieniem kryje się również kobieta mieszkająca w pobliżu. Okazuje się, że jest ona żoną psychiatry, doktora Pasteura. Niebawem na jaw wychodzą nowe fakty. Detektyw odkrywa, że żona doktora Pasteura jest lunatyczką. Cain zastanawia się, co mogło łączyć ją i archeologa(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Reporterka telewizyjna Sofie Talbert (Sharon Stone) jest zagorzałą przeciwniczką nielegalnej imigracji. Często krytykuje lewicowych polityków za ich liberalne podejście do tego problemu. Kiedy jej brat Aaron (Billy Zane) ginie bez śladu w Meksyku, kobieta ma okazję osobiście przyjrzeć się, jak naprawdę traktuje się nielegalnych imigrantów. Zrozpaczona Sofie jedzie do Meksyku i prowadzi prywatne śledztwo w sprawie zaginionego mężczyzny. Przy okazji poznaje prężnie działającą machinę przerzutu nielegalnych imigrantów przez granicę, ogromną skalę tego zjawiska, a przede wszystkim niesamowite okrucieństwo i bezwzględność ludzi odpowiedzialnych za ten proceder(n)</desc>
