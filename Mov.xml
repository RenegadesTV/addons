    <title lang="en">Bloody Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").(n)</desc>

The Grimbots melt the ice around Cuddles, and Glitch then uses Grim HQ to pull up the massive chunk of ice and carry it into the air. The Go Jetters are also in Ilulissat trying to spot some whales. They learn that Ilulissat means iceberg and that an iceberg is a huge chunk of ice which forms on land and then breaks off into the sea. Just then, Glitch's heavy iceberg falls from Grim HQ and starts sliding down the hill towards the town. The Go Jetters need to stop it and protect the town!</desc>

With the help of an engineer and her special cameras, Maddie show us how the gears and weights are controlled by a computer. Next, it's time for lift-off as Maddie heads to a space museum. We see how a spacesuit is made from lots of different layers of special materials to keep astronauts safe when they are working in space, and Maddie uses her special thermal camera to see how the suit keeps astronauts warm.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In today's episode, Maddie is relaxing at home, playing games and watching television. She shows us how a television screen works using millions of tiny squares called pixels. Using her special microscope camera, Maddie shows us how a pixel can make any colour from just three coloured lights - red, blue and green. Next she visits a factory where carpet is made. Maddie follows the journey that wool takes, from shearing a sheep to going through the factory, to end up in the carpets we have at home. Maddie uses her special slow-motion camera to show us how the different coloured threads are woven together on a loom to make a carpet.</desc>
