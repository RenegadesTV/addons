    <desc lang="en">New series. As one door closes, another one opens. No sooner has Channel 5 crowned its latest Big Brother winner, it reopens the house to make way for a fresh batch of contestants - but this time, of course, the new reality residents are all famous faces. Cue a roll call of soap actors, reality stars and glamour models, with the odd Loose Women presenter and US star thrown in for good measure. As always, Emma Willis introduces each one as they enter, ready to have their every word and move recorded for the enjoyment of the viewing public. It's to be hoped BB fans don't have anything else planned for the next few weeks(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One-off documentary exploring some of Britain's most bizarre parent-child relationships, where the mums and dads will do anything to look better than their kids. Those featured include 39-year-old Georgina, who was once a frumpy mum but has now followed daughter Kayla by becoming the image of a Barbie doll, complete with fake boobs and lips. Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gretchen i doktor Kaan zbliżają się do siebie. Mimo to kobieta nie potrafi powstrzymać się przed nieustannym porównywaniem się z jego byłą ukochaną. Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego(n)</desc>
