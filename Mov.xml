    <sub-title lang="en">A Copper's Tale</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The police wake to the news of a robbery, but the full extent of the crime and its haul - £2.6million - only becomes evident over the following days. It's clear the local CID is ill-equipped to solve a case of such magnitude, so Scotland Yard is called in, with a six-strong team of detectives headed by the Flying Squad's enigmatic chief Tommy Butler. In a race against time, they set out to identify every criminal involved and bring them to justice before they flee the country - but even if they can, will they find the money? Jim Broadbent stars in the concluding part of the drama about the most infamous heist in British history, with George Costigan, Robert Glenister, Tim Pigott-Smith, Nick Moran and John Salthouse. Written by Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Reeling from the revelation that his dad has another family, Jamie eventually finds his way home to face the music and is forced to admit to Mike that he stole his money. Jack and Boggie try to help Jamie deal with Hansard - with Jack persuading Jamie that an apology would help and Boggie using his guile to cement Jamie's second chance. When the truth comes out about why his father really left, Jamie lashes out, threatening to ruin everything all over again. However, a selfless act on the pitch shows Hansard what Jamie's really made of, and out of it comes a prize beyond Jamie's wildest dreams.(n)</desc>
