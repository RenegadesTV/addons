    <desc lang="en">Nine Russian hikers venture into a remote area of the Ural Mountains. Two weeks later, all nine are found dead. Five ambitious American college students are issued a grant to return to the site of the original events in the belief that they can uncover and document the truth of what happened. Their trek through the mountains, retracing the steps of that ill-fated journey, is plagued by strange and increasingly terrifying phenomena, all of which suggest that they are not alone. The forces behind the Dyatlov Pass Incident are waiting for them.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">68 Kill</title>
    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two fathers (Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin) join the ranks of the unemployed.

With no job possibilities on the horizon, the two dads decide to open their own day care facility, which boasts some fairly unconventional methods of tending the kids. As their day care starts to catch on, it launches them into a competition with Chapman Academy's tough-as-nails director (Anjelica Huston) for the hearts and minds of the children.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

Bezwzględna macocha (Adriana Esteves) i jej przyjaciel porzucają ją na wysypisku śmieci, gdzie musi walczyć o przetrwanie. Tam nawiązuje liczne przyjaźnie i odnajduje miłość swojego życia.
