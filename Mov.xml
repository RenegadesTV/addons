    <desc lang="en">The police wake to the news of a robbery, but the full extent of the crime and its haul - £2.6million - only becomes evident over the following days. It's clear the local CID is ill-equipped to solve a case of such magnitude, so Scotland Yard is called in, with a six-strong team of detectives headed by the Flying Squad's enigmatic chief Tommy Butler. In a race against time, they set out to identify every criminal involved and bring them to justice before they flee the country - but even if they can, will they find the money? Jim Broadbent stars in the concluding part of the drama about the most infamous heist in British history, with George Costigan, Robert Glenister, Tim Pigott-Smith, Nick Moran and John Salthouse. Written by Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall.(n)</desc>

Encouraging these women to strive for a more enlightened future, Watson challenges the administration and inspires her students to look beyond the image of what is, and consider the possibilities of what could be.</desc>

But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Whitney. "Can I Be Me"</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.(c)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley.(n)</desc>
