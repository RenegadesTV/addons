    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

Lekarka chce dobrze wypaść przed Markiem. Prowadzący badania doktor Sandstorm ignoruje poważne efekty uboczne, które wywołuje nowe lekarstwo. W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać. W tym samym czasie matka Gretchen odkrywa, że jej mąż ma romans z autorką romansideł(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Kobiety na balu lekarzy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać.

    <desc lang="pl">Haase odkrywa, że doktor Kaan może i uchodzi za dziwaka, lecz ma dobre serce. Lekarz udziela nieodpłatnej pomocy osobom, których nie stać na leczenie. Gretchen i doktor Hassmann, neurochirurg, operują Jenny, dziewczynę z nizin społecznych, która ukradła lekarce portfel. Gaby obmyśla plan, jak usidlić Meiera. Wpada na pewien pomysł. Barbara zapisuje się z córką na zajęcia z fitnessu, by podnieść swoją atrakcyjność w oczach męża. W ośrodku zdrowia wpada na kochankę męża, Elke. Wynikają z tego duże kłopoty, gdyż Gretchen nie umie trzymać języka za zębami(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki</title>
    <sub-title lang="pl">Kobiety na balu lekarzy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

Here they head straight to an enormous tea plantation where they grow the tea for the British export market. It's been a tough trip for our five teens and within minutes of arriving at the tea factory one of them feels unwell. With a man down how will the other four cope with the very physical work involved? Their boss is the strictest one yet and he is not a man to be messed with. At the end of their first shift the boss proves that he is very serious about tea when he sacks one of the team. They may be shocked but can they pull together as a team to turn this situation around? Show Me What You're Made Of is presented by Stacey Dooley(n)</desc>
