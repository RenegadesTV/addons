    <desc lang="en">Orson Welles' follow-up to "Citizen Kane" is this Best Picture nominee, an epic tale of the gradual decline of an old-monied Indianapolis family in the face of turn-of-the-century industrialization. The Ambersons' magnificent lives are apparent as the film opens, as is their sense of propriety. Welles, who directed, produced and adapted the screenplay from Booth Tarkington's novel, also provides the narration. Remade as a 2002 made-for-cable film. (cc).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Community on Solid Ground is a youth centre in Whalley Range. Before its current management took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common. That has dropped by 73 per cent since Community on Solid Ground came along, the kids can hang out, play sports and have a place to go that means they aren't hanging around the streets. Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics. Presented by Mark Wright and Lauren Layfield.(n)</desc>
