W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Obecnie przebywa ona na urlopie macierzyńskim po urodzeniu synka Franka, któremu podporządkowała całe życie. Mimo że ma partnera i może na nim polegać, odizolowała się od świata zewnętrznego. Przestała wychodzić z domu i spotykać się ze znajomymi, nie mówiąc o tym, że nie ma nawet czasu, by zadbać o siebie czy zatroszczyć się o swoje dobre samopoczucie. Agata jest też nieśmiała, czuje strach przed nawiązywaniem nowych kontaktów. Niebawem będzie musiała też wrócić do pracy, co wywołuje w niej mnóstwo obaw. Chciałaby odbudować pewność siebie i ujrzeć w sobie atrakcyjną kobietę. Eksperci spróbują przekonać ją, że szczęśliwa mama, to także szczęśliwa rodzina</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Twórcy serii w każdym odcinku przybliżają widzom gorączkowe ślubne przygotowania kolejnej pary narzeczonych. Zwłaszcza przyszłe panny młode są zdeterminowane, aby mieć idealny ślub. Dla wszystkich, którzy stają im na drodze są złośliwe, wymagające i egoistyczne. Aby zrealizować swój cel, są gotowe zapomnieć o skrupułach czy sentymentach. Wszystko bowiem ma być tak, jak to one sobie wymarzyły!</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Wielu rodziców nie wie, co jest dobre dla ich pociech. Autorzy programu dokładnie badają dzieci należące do jednej z brytyjskich rodzin. Następnie przeprowadzają stymulację pokazującą, jak będzie się zmieniał ich stan zdrowia w ciągu najbliższych kilkunastu czy nawet kilkudziesięciu lat. Wyniki są zastraszające - dzieciom często grozi nie tylko nadwaga, ale też cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Na podstawie zebranych informacji zespół ekspertów przygotowuje plan działania, który ma pomóc rodzinom zmienić złe nawyki i odmienić bieg wydarzeń. Od rodziców zależy, czy zastosują się do wskazówek specjalistów</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Obecnie przebywa ona na urlopie macierzyńskim po urodzeniu synka Franka, któremu podporządkowała całe życie. Mimo że ma partnera i może na nim polegać, odizolowała się od świata zewnętrznego. Przestała wychodzić z domu i spotykać się ze znajomymi, nie mówiąc o tym, że nie ma nawet czasu, by zadbać o siebie czy zatroszczyć się o swoje dobre samopoczucie. Agata jest też nieśmiała, czuje strach przed nawiązywaniem nowych kontaktów. Niebawem będzie musiała też wrócić do pracy, co wywołuje w niej mnóstwo obaw. Chciałaby odbudować pewność siebie i ujrzeć w sobie atrakcyjną kobietę. Eksperci spróbują przekonać ją, że szczęśliwa mama, to także szczęśliwa rodzina</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Wielu rodziców nie wie, co jest dobre dla ich pociech. Autorzy programu dokładnie badają dzieci należące do jednej z brytyjskich rodzin. Następnie przeprowadzają stymulację pokazującą, jak będzie się zmieniał ich stan zdrowia w ciągu najbliższych kilkunastu czy nawet kilkudziesięciu lat. Wyniki są zastraszające - dzieciom często grozi nie tylko nadwaga, ale też cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Na podstawie zebranych informacji zespół ekspertów przygotowuje plan działania, który ma pomóc rodzinom zmienić złe nawyki i odmienić bieg wydarzeń. Od rodziców zależy, czy zastosują się do wskazówek specjalistów</desc>

It's been a tough trip for our five teens and within minutes of arriving at the tea factory one of them feels unwell. With a man down how will the other four cope with the very physical work involved? Their boss is the strictest one yet and he is not a man to be messed with. At the end of their first shift the boss proves that he is very serious about tea when he sacks one of the team. They may be shocked but can they pull together as a team to turn this situation around? Show Me What You're Made Of is presented by Stacey Dooley(n)</desc>
