    <title lang="en">Never Been Kissed</title>
    <desc lang="en">Drew Barrymore enchants as a Chicago newspaper editor who relives her hellish teen years while on an undercover assignment at a local high school. Barrymore's great, but the film celebrates the fact that her character wins over the same type of “in crowd” that taunted her as a teen. David Arquette costars as her cool brother. Raja Gosnell is the director, and Barrymore served as executive producer. (cc).</desc>

But soon she finds out that everything at school is a little bit different and not the same. The school smells funny, the desks are different and worst of all, its not Mrs Hanson its Mrs Shorring! As the weather starts to change Lola discovers all kinds of things about Autumn are different - and she doesn't like it one bit. To cap it all, her big Autumn picture goes all wrong. So Lola and Lotta decide to hibernate like hedgie-hogs, they will come out from under the bed next spring when everything is the same again! But will Charlie be able to lure Lola and Lotta out of their winter nest?</desc>
