    <sub-title lang="en">Cuba</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The presenter cruises around Cuba aboard the Celestyal Crystal, starting and ending in Havana, sampling the relatively new tourist industry of the Caribbean island. A stop in Cienfuegos leads to a salsa lesson and a flying visit to Jamaica allows Jane to have lunch in, or rather on, a floating Rasta Raft just off the beach in Runaway Bay. Before heading back to Havana, there's just time to join in the fun of a house party in Santiago de Cuba. And as the singer soon discovers, no one parties quite like the Cubans.</desc>

It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?</desc>
