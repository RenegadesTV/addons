With this eye-opening drama, he looks at this avoidable human catastrophe from a somewhat different perspective. Featuring music by Tom Waits</desc>

Prawniczka odkrywa, że pracowała już u niego bezpośrednio po szkole prawniczej i najwyraźniej łączyło ich coś więcej niż tylko relacje służbowe. Oczywiście Jane nie ma pojęcia, co wydarzyło się między nimi przed ośmiu laty. Prawniczka zajmie się sprawą, którą wtedy prowadziła - morderstwa osiemnastoletniej Eleny Estrady. Upewnia się, że do zbrodni musiało dojść, gdy dziewczyna była w drodze ze swojego domu w Malibu do rezydencji przyjaciela Nate Persky'ego. Jednak ojciec chłopaka dał mu wtedy alibi i podtrzymuje je. A ponieważ Warren Persky to jeden z najbardziej wpływowych ludzi w Los Angeles, prokurator nie śmiał wątpić w jego słowo. Jane przeżywa szok, gdy ustala, że Alan Robert osobiście interweniował przed laty, aby ówczesny chłopak ofiary nie trafił do kręgu podejrzanych. Tymczasem Stacy popada w tarapaty, z których próbuje ją wybawić Grayston</desc>

Badania wykazały zmianę na siatkówce, którą trzeba usunąć operacyjnie. Pielęgniarka postanawia poddać się zabiegowi. Ewa przybywa do szpitala w towarzystwie córki Luizy. Czeka ją szybki zabieg, który poprzedza szereg dodatkowych badań kontrolnych. Te z kolei wykazują, że oprócz problemów z siatkówką występuje u niej zaćma. Lekarze przeprowadzą dwa zabiegi. Wkrótce czeka ją badanie kontrolne, które wykaże, czy zabieg powiódł się i nie ma komplikacji</desc>

Mężczyzna uważa, że jest to poniżające dla jego zmarłej narzeczonej, a w dodatku bezprawne. Za bezpodstawne wykorzystanie wizerunku córki może pozwać kasyno matka Deb, Bobbie. Niestety Jane tuż przed tragicznym wypadkiem - jeszcze jako Deb - udzieliła fotografowi stosownego pełnomocnictwa. Tymczasem matka prawniczki, Elaine zostaje oskarżona o przestępstwo federalne i aresztowana. Wściekła otworzyła bowiem drzwi samolotu, w którym przez kilka godzin wraz z setką innych pasażerów była przetrzymywana na płycie lotniska. Elaine twierdzi, że użyła trapu ratunkowego, gdyż nie miała innego wyjścia, jednak nagranie telewizyjne z miejsca wydarzeń dowodzi, że doskonale się przy tym bawiła. Z kolei Fred, który dał Stacy do zrozumienia, że chce od niej odejść, aby w ich związku wszystko pozostało bez zmian, musi nocować w gabinecie Kim</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Współczesny Nowy Jork. Twórca słynnej szkoły baletowej, Alex McGrath (Matthew Walker), umiera na atak serca. Losy jego zespołu są bardzo niepewne. Wszyscy obawiają się, że to koniec "Dance Motive", legendarnego układu choreograficznego, który nigdy nie został zaprezentowany na scenie. Premiera słynnego tańca może uratować szkołę od upadku, ale by się odbyła niezbędny jest udział trójki tancerzy, którzy niegdyś uczestniczyli w tworzeniu "Dance Motive". Przez siedem lat w życiu Chrissy Lindh (Lisa Niemi), Travisa MacPhearsona (Patrick Swayze) i Maksa Delano (George De La Pena) wiele się zmieniło. Wszyscy troje zdają sobie sprawę, że ich występ uratuje szkołę. Wspólna praca nad premierą pomaga im wyjaśnić dawne nieporozumienia i uporządkować własne życie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Jane przeżywa prawdziwy szok, gdy zastaje mamę Deb w sytuacji intymnej w gabinecie swojego szefa. Siostra Kim, Jenna Kaswell-Bailey potrzebuje dobrego adwokata, który reprezentowałby ją na sprawie rozwodowej. Jej mąż posiada ogromny majątek, ona jednak bardziej od pieniędzy chce dostać pewien stary zegar będący w jego rodzinie od stuleci. Tymczasem Jane reprezentuje dwie studentki, które samodzielnie wymierzyły sprawiedliwość i teraz grozi im więzienie za porwanie. Jedna z nich, Mia Dalton została miesiąc wcześniej zgwałcona przez Vince'a Adamsa - gwiazdę uniwersyteckiej drużyny sportowej. Policja nie wszczęła dochodzenia i chłopak pozostał bezkarny, więc dziewczyna i jej najbliższa przyjaciółka zwabiły go do motelu, skrępowały i poniżyły. W trakcie rozprawy Jane jest zmuszona dowodzić, że uczelnia jest winna zaniedbania, a może nawet tuszowania gwałtu. Z tego powodu gwałtownie sprzecza się z Graysonem, który studiował na Hammet University i broni dobrego imienia uniwersytetu(n)</desc>

Prawniczka odkrywa, że pracowała już u niego bezpośrednio po szkole prawniczej i najwyraźniej łączyło ich coś więcej niż tylko relacje służbowe. Oczywiście Jane nie ma pojęcia, co wydarzyło się między nimi przed ośmiu laty. Prawniczka zajmie się sprawą, którą wtedy prowadziła - morderstwa osiemnastoletniej Eleny Estrady. Upewnia się, że do zbrodni musiało dojść, gdy dziewczyna była w drodze ze swojego domu w Malibu do rezydencji przyjaciela Nate Persky'ego. Jednak ojciec chłopaka dał mu wtedy alibi i podtrzymuje je. A ponieważ Warren Persky to jeden z najbardziej wpływowych ludzi w Los Angeles, prokurator nie śmiał wątpić w jego słowo. Jane przeżywa szok, gdy ustala, że Alan Robert osobiście interweniował przed laty, aby ówczesny chłopak ofiary nie trafił do kręgu podejrzanych.

Niestety Jane tuż przed tragicznym wypadkiem - jeszcze jako Deb - udzieliła fotografowi stosownego pełnomocnictwa. Tymczasem matka prawniczki, Elaine zostaje oskarżona o przestępstwo federalne i aresztowana. Wściekła otworzyła bowiem drzwi samolotu, w którym przez kilka godzin wraz z setką innych pasażerów była przetrzymywana na płycie lotniska. Elaine twierdzi, że użyła trapu ratunkowego, gdyż nie miała innego wyjścia, jednak nagranie telewizyjne z miejsca wydarzeń dowodzi, że doskonale się przy tym bawiła. Z kolei Fred, który dał Stacy do zrozumienia, że chce od niej odejść, aby w ich związku wszystko pozostało bez zmian, musi nocować w gabinecie Kim</desc>

Wszyscy obawiają się, że to koniec "Dance Motive", legendarnego układu choreograficznego, który nigdy nie został zaprezentowany na scenie. Premiera słynnego tańca może uratować szkołę od upadku, ale by się odbyła niezbędny jest udział trójki tancerzy, którzy niegdyś uczestniczyli w tworzeniu "Dance Motive". Przez siedem lat w życiu Chrissy Lindh (Lisa Niemi), Travisa MacPhearsona (Patrick Swayze) i Maksa Delano (George De La Pena) wiele się zmieniło. Wszyscy troje zdają sobie sprawę, że ich występ uratuje szkołę. Wspólna praca nad premierą pomaga im wyjaśnić dawne nieporozumienia i uporządkować własne życie</desc>

Nie powstrzymuje jej to przed głośnym oznajmianiem swojego niezadowolenia. Najpierw zmusza swojego narzeczonego, by kupił pączki, później wykłóca się z druhnami, które były nie dość entuzjastycznie nastawione do jej fryzury, a na koniec doprowadza do łez swoją matkę. To jednak nie koniec kłopotów. W tym czasie ogarnięta szałem organizowania Johanne zaprowadza w domu prawdziwy terror.

Siostra Kim, Jenna Kaswell-Bailey potrzebuje dobrego adwokata, który reprezentowałby ją na sprawie rozwodowej. Jej mąż posiada ogromny majątek, ona jednak bardziej od pieniędzy chce dostać pewien stary zegar będący w jego rodzinie od stuleci. Tymczasem Jane reprezentuje dwie studentki, które samodzielnie wymierzyły sprawiedliwość i teraz grozi im więzienie za porwanie. Jedna z nich, Mia Dalton została miesiąc wcześniej zgwałcona przez Vince'a Adamsa - gwiazdę uniwersyteckiej drużyny sportowej. Policja nie wszczęła dochodzenia i chłopak pozostał bezkarny, więc dziewczyna i jej najbliższa przyjaciółka zwabiły go do motelu, skrępowały i poniżyły. W trakcie rozprawy Jane jest zmuszona dowodzić, że uczelnia jest winna zaniedbania, a może nawet tuszowania gwałtu. Z tego powodu gwałtownie sprzecza się z Graysonem, który studiował na Hammet University i broni dobrego imienia uniwersytetu(n)</desc>
