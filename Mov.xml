    <desc lang="pl">Trwają przygotowania do operacji Emila i jego mamy. Waldkowi, mężowi Elżbiety, ciężko opanować emocje. Z kolei Bożena i Olga idą na siłownię, by zgubić kilka kilogramów przed zabiegiem. Na miejscu spotykają Karolinę, która również musi schudnąć. Emil i Ela po operacji jedzą swój pierwszy posiłek - kleik. Tymczasem na siłowni Karolina zaczyna mieć problem z kręgosłupem i musi opuścić salę treningową. Bożena i Olga wyciskają siódme poty. Emil po powrocie ze szpitala postanawia nauczyć swojego pupila Dolara posłuszeństwa i zapisuje go na tresurę, co też zwiększa aktywność chłopaka. Ela po incydentach z ciśnieniem zaczyna regularnie je kontrolować. Bożena i Olga przechodzą próbę wagi</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Prezentacja prawdziwych, najczęściej wykonywanych w Polsce, zabiegów chirurgicznych. Tu nie ma miejsca na scenariusz. Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Odcinek poświęcono jaskrze, często występującej chorobie oczu, która nieleczona prowadzi do utraty wzroku. Widzowie poznają historię Sylwii. Kobieta oczekuje na operację nowatorską metodą zwaną kanaloplastyką. Eksperci wyjaśnią, na czym polega ten zabieg i czym różni się od powszechnie stosowanego. Kolejna bohaterka ma przejść bardzo skomplikowaną operację. Podczas jednego zabiegu lekarze postarają się wyleczyć jej jaskrę i usunąć zaćmę(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Prezentacja prawdziwych, najczęściej wykonywanych w Polsce, zabiegów chirurgicznych. Tu nie ma miejsca na scenariusz. Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Odcinek poświęcono jaskrze, często występującej chorobie oczu, która nieleczona prowadzi do utraty wzroku. Widzowie poznają historię Sylwii. Kobieta oczekuje na operację nowatorską metodą zwaną kanaloplastyką. Eksperci wyjaśnią, na czym polega ten zabieg i czym różni się od powszechnie stosowanego. Kolejna bohaterka ma przejść bardzo skomplikowaną operację. Podczas jednego zabiegu lekarze postarają się wyleczyć jej jaskrę i usunąć zaćmę(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">My Life: The Boy on the Bicycle.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A guided tour by 16-year-old Syrian boy, Ahmed, through one of the biggest refugee camps in the world - Zaatari in Jordan. Ahmed is like any other boy his age, except he's had to leave everything behind, including his toys and technology, to move to the refugee camp. Life in Zaatari is nothing compared to home. When the Syrian civil war began in 2012 his family had to abandon their affluent lives and flee across the border to Zaatari camp with thousands of others for safety. Now living in a storage container for a home after his house was destroyed in the civil war, he has lived in Zaatari for three years, along with 80,000 other refugees, who can't leave the camp without permission. Despite their camp having everything they need, from shops to a hospital, school and football pitches, life is very different to how it was before. Ahmed doesn't let this affect his positivity though, and he finds new ways to have fun with his friends - even if it is in a desert sandstorm followed by flooding. As Ahmed cycles around the five mile square camp he introduces some of the other inspirational children who live there and reveals the reality of life in a refugee camp from a child's unique point of view.(n)</desc>
