    <title lang="en">The Sum of All Fears</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ben Affleck takes over the role of hero CIA agent Jack Ryan in this box office hit based on the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy. Low-level analyst Ryan is elevated to prominence by his expertise on an obscure strongman (Ciaran Hinds) after the politician's surprising ascendancy to the Russian presidency. But that's just the tip of a very large, very lethal iceberg involving neo-Nazis and a nuclear warhead smuggled into the U.S. by terrorists. Morgan Freeman, Bridget Moynihan and Liev Schreiber costar in this espionage adventure.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tehran-born Bahari is a 42-year-old broadcast journalist with Canadian citizenship living in London. In June 2009, Bahari returns to Iran to interview Mir-Hossein Mousavi, who is the prime challenger to controversial incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As Mousavi's supporters rise up to protest Ahmadinejad's victory, Bahari endures great personal risk by submitting camera footage of the unfolding street riots to the BBC. Bahari is soon arrested by police, who proceed to torture and interrogate him over the next 118 days.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Community on Solid Ground is a youth centre in Whalley Range. Before its current management took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common. That has dropped by 73 per cent since Community on Solid Ground came along, the kids can hang out, play sports and have a place to go that means they aren't hanging around the streets. Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics. Presented by Mark Wright and Lauren Layfield.</desc>
