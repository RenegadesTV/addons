Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Każdy rodzic wie, że czekolada, chipsy czy coca-cola szkodzą dzieciom. Nie znaczy to jednak, że dorośli potrafią odmówić swoim pociechom tych smakołyków. Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>

Lekarka potrzebuje męskiego ramienia, by się wypłakać, lecz niestety nie ma co liczyć na ginekologa Kaana. Może mieć tylko nadzieję, że doktor odejdzie dla niej od żony. Jakby kłopotów było mało przyjaciółka Haase zapada na raka i nie zgadza się na leczenie. W życiu lekarki pojawia się też zamożny Alexis von Buren, który jest nią wyraźnie zainteresowany. Podczas oglądania paczka chusteczek i pudełko czekoladek są wskazane, gdyż zapowiada się naprawdę wzruszający odcinek</desc>

W planie dnia upokorzenie ze strony chorego na raka pacjenta i rozmowa z matką o jej dużo młodszym partnerze o artystycznej duszy. Informacja o zostaniu druhną wyprowadza Gretchen z równowagi na tyle, że lekarka znów zapomina o diecie. Nadchodzi czas na lunch, ciastko i kawę, a zaraz po nich drugi lunch. Po tych wszystkich rewelacjach Haase nie ma siły pocieszać doktora Kaana, który poznał nieciekawe fakty z życia swojej żony. Lekarka rezygnuje więc z kolacji</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać?

W planie dnia upokorzenie ze strony chorego na raka pacjenta i rozmowa z matką o jej dużo młodszym partnerze o artystycznej duszy. Informacja o zostaniu druhną wyprowadza Gretchen z równowagi na tyle, że lekarka znów zapomina o diecie. Nadchodzi czas na lunch, ciastko i kawę, a zaraz po nich drugi lunch. Po tych wszystkich rewelacjach Haase nie ma siły pocieszać doktora Kaana, który poznał nieciekawe fakty z życia swojej żony. Lekarka rezygnuje więc z kolacji(n)</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania.

Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Każdy rodzic wie, że czekolada, chipsy czy coca-cola szkodzą dzieciom. Nie znaczy to jednak, że dorośli potrafią odmówić swoim pociechom tych smakołyków. Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>

We własnej skórze czuje się tak źle, że wycofała się nawet z życia towarzyskiego. Marzy, aby znów stać się taka jak dawniej - przebojowa, towarzyska i pełną energii. Widzowie przekonają się, czy uda jej się osiągnąć ten cel i czy problemy z figurą, to jedyny powód zmartwień w życiu Pauliny</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Bohaterką odcinka jest 34-letnia Małgosia z Bładnic Dolnych, niewielkiej miejscowości koło Skoczowa. Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy is helping to spring clean and is having fun, until Maura decides that Roy should go through his toys and give away the ones he doesn't play with anymore. Roy can't believe it ­ he loves all of his toys and doesn't want to give any to Mrs Barker's Charity Shop, The Old Bag. Roy isn't the only family member having trouble parting with their old, unused items. Bill becomes incredibly attached to some old tight fitting clothes, and there's a scarf Maura has her eye on too. Mr Barker is just as reluctant as Roy, and when Mrs Barker is about to catch them both hiding out in Reg's shed, Roy wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy loses his brand new cape in a villainous encounter with The Messer and Glitterella. He had given Finn his old cape ­ much to Finn's delight, and is reluctant to take it back, but Finn reassures him that who we are is much more important than the things we own. Back in reality, Roy remembers this, and teaches Mr Barker how good it feels to pass things on!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy is intrigued when Joan calls over to style Maura and Becky's hair. Bill suggests Roy should use his natural creative talent to try styling Maura and Becky. Roy gives it a go and is delighted with the results. Maura, Becky, Bill and Joan are all amazed with the work Roy does on changing their looks. Roy is eager to have a makeover of his own. Joan does the honours, but every time she changes Roy's hairstyle, it plops back to its original appearance. Roy is crestfallen to realise he cannot change the way he looks. What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, Wonder Roy combats Gliterella with his new creation - a soapy water pistol. But, being Wonder Roy, he allows her the creative freedom to add a bit of sparkle to the dreary local library. Back in reality, Roy uses his creativity to fashion a wig for himself, but sadly accepts he is wasting his time. Bill points Roy's cartoon uniqueness and creative flair is something to be proud of. Roy finds solace in his dad's words and celebrates the fact he is a genius when it comes to making over people and in transforming the world around him with creativity</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy wishes he had a cartoon, little brother who wants to play all the time. Not a big sister who gets mad at him. Nodding off, a dream bubble above his head shows Roy playing with Zip-a little, cartoon brother. When Roy wakes up, he is thrilled to find that Zip has hopped out of his dream and into reality. But things don't quite go according to plan! Roy steps out of his room to find an upturned laundry basket on the landing and clothes everywhere! In the kitchen, Zip wolfs down a cake, and out in the garden he creates a grass whirlwind over Bill's newly mowed lawn. While Roy cleans up Zip's mess with a rake, he tells Tristan all about his cartoon brother who escaped from his dream and is causing havoc. Roy realises that having a cartoon brother who wants to play all the time, might not always be such fun. Roy knows they have to get Zip back to Dreamland and wonders - What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, The Messer is wreaking havoc, until Wonder Roy puts a halt to his shenanigans by bringing in The Messer's mother, wisely working out that everyone gets homesick. Back in reality, Tristan and Roy work together to show Zip what he's missing in Dreamland? endless cakes and endless fun! Zip leaps onto Roy's bed and bounces into the dream bubble. Lesson learned, Roy tidies the bedroom for Becky. He finishes, just in the nick of time, as Becky arrives home with some cake to share with her favourite, little cartoon brother(n)</desc>

Teams summon wizards and aliens on a busy city street corner and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life! But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? Get ready for some gut-busting reactions when Svetlana and Neptune's 'Blizzard-ade' faces off with James and Caiden's 'Alien Crash Landing'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. And for the winning team, CJ and Andy have planned the ultimate mega prank with the wackiest obstacle course challenge ever created! Exploding cakes, spraying cream and a crazed clown aren't the only obstacles to avoid on this course. If the 'target' is going to make it through, he'll have to dodge a grizzly bear too!
