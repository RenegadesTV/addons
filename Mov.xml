W towarzystwie jednego z nich Haase wybierze się do Las Vegas, nie wiadomo jednak, czy zamierza tam spróbować szczęścia w kasynie czy wziąć szybki ślub. Gabi dokona przerażającego odkrycia, które jest związane z mężczyzną o imieniu Kalle. Nie zabraknie seksu, trzech propozycji małżeństwa, tajemniczej plantacji marihuany - ale niestety nie oznacza to szczęśliwego zakończenia</desc>

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Relacje Haase z mężczyznami przypominają rozgrywki sportowe, łącznie z wymianą koszulek. Tym razem przeciwników jest trzech.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania.

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Relacje Haase z mężczyznami przypominają rozgrywki sportowe, łącznie z wymianą koszulek. Tym razem przeciwników jest trzech. Przyjaciółka Gina stawia Haase tarota, by odkryć przed nią przyszłość</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania.

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Relacje Haase z mężczyznami przypominają rozgrywki sportowe, łącznie z wymianą koszulek. Tym razem przeciwników jest trzech. Przyjaciółka Gina stawia Haase tarota, by odkryć przed nią przyszłość</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Twórcy przeprowadzają eksperyment. Za pomocą medycznych, żywieniowych i psychologicznych testów tworzą symulację, dzięki której widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będą wyglądać współczesne dzieci w życiu dorosłym. Wynik jest bardzo niepokojący. Okazuje się, że oprócz nadwagi grożą im niebezpieczne choroby, m.in. cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Nadzieję na poprawę niesie zespół ekspertów. Specjaliści opracowują zasady zdrowych nawyków. Ich celem jest zmiana dotychczasowych nawyków i zapewnienie dzieciom zdrowej oraz szczęśliwej przyszłości</desc>
