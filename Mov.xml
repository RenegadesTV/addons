    <desc lang="en">For Martha (Martina Gedeck), the tightly-wound workaholic chef at the center of Sandra Nettelbeck's charming and unsentimental romantic comedy, cooking is the way to effectively relate to others. A skilled and respected professional at a fancy high-end Italian restaurant in Hamburg, Martha lives a solitary life away from her immaculate kitchen. Yet some life-changing surprises are in store when Martha must take custody of her orphaned eight-year-old niece and her professional domain is invaded by an exuberant new sous-chef (Sergio Castellitto).</desc>

Here, Leslie and Jess rule as King and Queen among the incredible creatures they create, and not even the forces of evil can break their bond.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Phantom of the Opera</title>
    <desc lang="en">In perhaps his greatest role, Lon Chaney portrays the title character in this silent classic, a crazed, horrifically disfigured composer who takes a beautiful young singer under his wing and terrorizes an opera house in an effort to make her a star. The opera singer's unmasking of the Phantom in his subterranean lair is one of cinema's most iconic screen moments. Chaney created his own special makeup effects.</desc>
