    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu.

Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal</desc>
