Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

Zleceniodawca chciał powierzyć to zadanie dwóm dostawcom: jednym z nich miał być Bernard Dassin, drugim - Frank. Ten ostatni, kierowany dumą i troską o własne bezpieczeństwo, nie przyjmuje oferty. Zmienia jednak zdanie, kiedy klient obwieszcza, że sprawa jest powiązana z zaginięciem ukochanej Franka. Istnieją dowody na to, że w jej zniknięcie był zamieszany minister, który obecnie przebywa właśnie na Półwyspie Krymskim. W tej sytuacji Frank jest zmuszony połączyć siły z Dassinem i jego pomocnikiem, Julesem Faroux. Dostawca nie wierzy w lojalność swoich nowych wspólników</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy.

Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>
