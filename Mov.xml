    <title lang="en">Whitney. "Can I Be Me"</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.(n)</desc>
