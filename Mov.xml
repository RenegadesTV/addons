    <desc lang="en">The police wake to the news of a robbery, but the full extent of the crime and its haul - £2.6million - only becomes evident over the following days.

    <sub-title lang="pl">Kobiety na balu lekarzy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gretchen i doktor Kaan zbliżają się do siebie. Mimo to kobieta nie potrafi powstrzymać się przed nieustannym porównywaniem się z jego byłą ukochaną. Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery.

Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Kobiety na balu lekarzy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gretchen i doktor Kaan zbliżają się do siebie. Mimo to kobieta nie potrafi powstrzymać się przed nieustannym porównywaniem się z jego byłą ukochaną. Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu.

Today teams invade an office building and for unsuspecting targets, it's going to be anything but another... day at the office!

It's a battle between the head-scratching 'Office Switcheroo' and the super-charged 'Trainwreck Hallway'! Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, Marc, Andy and Devon have planned a MEGA PRANK packed with ninja power! The setting is a martial arts dojo, complete with flying rigs, flying crates and flying people! Will the targets flap their wings and take flight too? One thing's for sure, this MEGA PRANK is gonna be fly!</desc>
