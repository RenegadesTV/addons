    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery.

    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley(n)</desc>

It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in.

Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">My Life: Our Desert Island Home follows the adventures of brothers Felix (11) and Luca (10) who live on an Island called Fofoa in Tonga. After living through the worst tropical cyclone in memory, Felix and Luca enlist a local conservation charity to help them survey their coral reef to see the effects of the storm and check the long term damage from climate change. Protecting the marine life is vital to keep attracting the migrating whales back every year, not least because the boys' favourite hobby is taking visitors swimming to meet these magnificent animals. Join Felix and Luca as they show you what living on an Island is all about(n)</desc>
