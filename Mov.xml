    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

What does is the thought of not being there for his kids. (repeat).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Schoolboy Ben is bored witless after being made to stay with his grandma. All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben.</desc>
