As it happens, Jigsaw is eager to be put behind bars in order to throw the authorities off his trail as he once again punishes people who in his eyes have transgressed the boundaries of acceptable moral behavior. But instead of trapping two people in a filthy dungeon where they must engage in a terrible contest in order to win their freedom, eight people have been locked away by Jigsaw, and they must torture their bodies and minds to achieve the terrible justice Jigsaw seeks.

When Hassan's family is forced to move from their native India, his Papa (Om Puri) relocates to a peaceful hamlet in Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in the south of France.

Meanwhile, across the street at the traditional French restaurant Le Saule Pleureu, uptight proprietor Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) doesn't exactly welcome the competition. When Madame Mallory ignites a bitter feud that quickly escalates, the only hope for a peaceful resolution lies in Hassan's talent for French haute cuisine, and his growing affections for Mme. Mallory's pretty young sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon). Subsequently impressed by Hassan's undeniable culinary talents, Mme. Mallory agrees to become Hassan's mentor, in the process providing the perfect creative environment where his unique fusion cuisine can thrive.

Shortly after appearing to Grace in spectral form, Jamie also begins to haunt Adam, whose lingering guilt prompts him to begin communicating with the troubled apparition. Later, his relationship with Gracie intensifying as his relationship with his paralyzed single-mother (Liv Tyler) turns sour, Adam follows Jamie's advice and flees to an abandoned farmhouse, where he has a terrifying encounter with a malevolent spirit whose motivations appear to be much darker than those of the mournful Jamie.

Both of their love lives are disasters, and after rekindling their friendship, they vow to keep their relationship platonic so they can help each other with their problems: Jake is a womanizer who can't commit, while Lainey hasn't gotten over a married doctor (Adam Scott) she's been having an affair with. In time, Jake falls for a high-powered businesswoman (Amanda Peet) who buys his start-up company, while Lainey starts dating a financier (Marc Blucas). Yet through it all, they feel closer to each other than to any of their actual partners. Jason Mantzoukas and Andrea Savage co-star as a married couple who are friends with Jake, and who pressure him to settle down to avoid being the weird single guy at their parties (the end credits feature a hilarious sequence in which the two of them banter about the state of their marriage). Sleeping With Other People was written and directed by Leslye Headland(n)</desc>

Vowing to get even with the gun manufacturer who created the weapon, Joe targets the manufacturer's widow, Liberty Wallace (Linda Fiorento), for a complex scheme of justice and retribution.

As the clock ticks inexorably closer to the inevitable explosion, the terrified but resourceful Liberty tries to talk her way out of her predicament--a task made virtually impossible by Joe's bizarre "conditions". First screened in America at the 2002 Palm Springs International Film Festival, Liberty Stands Still did not gain a widespread showing until it was picked up for cable broadcast by Cinemax on August 10, 2002(n)</desc>

Edward Cole (Nicholson) is a corporate billionaire who is currently sharing a hospital room with blue-collar mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman). Though initially the pair seems to have nothing in common, conversation gradually reveals that both men have a long list of goals they wish to accomplish before they kick the bucket, and an unrealized desire to discover what kind of men they really are. But one can't accomplish such lofty objectives from the confines of a hospital bed, so now, in order to live their lives to the absolute fullest, Edward and Carter will have to make a break for it. With a checklist that includes playing the poker tables in Monte Carlo, consuming copious amounts of caviar, racing the fastest machines on four wheels, and much more, these two terminally ill men will do their best to fit a lifetime of experience into their last remaining days while forging an unlikely, but truly remarkable, friendship</desc>

Rowling. Rumor has it that the dreaded Lord Voldemort has returned, but Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) isn't so sure what to make of all the hearsay currently floating around the campus of Hogwarts. Suspecting that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) may be fueling the rumors regarding Voldemort's return in order to undermine his authority and lay claim to his job, Fudge entrusts newly arrived Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) with the task of tracking Dumbledore and keeping a protective watch over the nervous student body. The young wizards of Hogwarts will need something much more effective than Umbridge's Ministry-approved course in defensive magic if they are to truly succeed in the extraordinary battle that lies ahead, however, and when the administration fails to provide the students with the tools that they will need to defend Hogwarts against the fearsome powers of the Dark Arts, Hermione (Emma Watson), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Harry take it upon themselves to recruit a small group of students to form "Dumbledore's Army" in preparation for the ultimate supernatural showdown</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees</desc>

    <title lang="en">Racing Stripes</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horse of a different pattern becomes a spoiler in a high-stakes race in the family-friendly comedy-drama. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) is a farmer who once earned his living training racehorses before his wife was killed in an accident while riding, which led him to leave the racing game. Nolan tends to his farm and looks after his daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) and a large flock of animals, who speak to one another but not to humans. After a traveling circus passes through town, a zebra pony is left behind; Nolan takes in the animal, intending to return it to the circus, but at Channing's insistence they keep the zebra, naming him Stripes (voiced by Frankie Muniz). Channing loves Stripes, and the zebra is welcomed by the other critters on the farm, including grumpy Shetland pony Tucker (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), slow-moving hound dog Lightning (voiced by Snoop Dogg), a New Jersey-born pelican named Goose (voiced by Joe Pantoliano), skinny-brained rooster Reggie (voiced by Jeff Foxworthy), and deep-thinking goat Franny (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg). Channing discovers that Stripes can outrun nearly any horse around, and Woodzie (M. Emmett Walsh), a local character who has spent years handicapping the ponies, is convinced the zebra would be shoo-in in the Kentucky Open, a prestigious race held at the estate of champion horse breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Channing believes Stripes can win, but he'll need the help of Nolan, who isn't so sure he's ready to start training again; meanwhile, Stripes gets plenty of advice from the other farm animals about his big step onto the race track. Mandy Moore, David Spade, and Steve Harvey also contribute their voice talents to the picture(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Classic fairy tales get a vigorous working over in this comic, computer-animated fantasy based on the children's book by William Steig. Mike Meyers stars as Shrek, a green ogre who's perfectly content to live alone in a vast swamp, until it's suddenly overrun with refugees such as The Three Bears, Pinocchio, The Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, and many others. It seems that the evil and very short Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has ordered the storybook denizens of his realm, Duloc, to be summarily deported. Shrek confronts Farquaad, accompanied by a wisecracking Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and the disgruntled ogre is offered a deal: Farquaad desires to marry Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), but she's being held captive by a dragon in a far-off realm. Rescue Fiona and return her to Duloc, and Shrek's swamp will once again be his own. So begins a series of adventures for Shrek and his trusty "steed." Shrek also stars Linda Hunt(n)</desc>
