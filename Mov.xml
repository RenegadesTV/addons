Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?(n).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Of all the trees at Earth Mama's nursery, little Douglas fir tree Albert has the biggest ambition. He hopes to one day be the star of the show as the Christmas tree sitting at the heart of Empire City. As the festive season approaches, Albert set his mind to helping all the other plants at the nursery into the Christmas spirit. However, when a city-wide news bulletin announces the search for this year's tree, Albert spots a chance to live his dream, and sets out on a journey with help from his friends Maisie, a persistently positive palm tree, and Gene, a blisteringly honest weed. Festive animated adventure, with the voices of Bobby Moynihan, Sasheer Zamata and Judah Friedlander(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Of all the trees at Earth Mama's nursery, little Douglas fir tree Albert has the biggest ambition. He hopes to one day be the star of the show as the Christmas tree sitting at the heart of Empire City. As the festive season approaches, Albert set his mind to helping all the other plants at the nursery into the Christmas spirit. However, when a city-wide news bulletin announces the search for this year's tree, Albert spots a chance to live his dream, and sets out on a journey with help from his friends Maisie, a persistently positive palm tree, and Gene, a blisteringly honest weed. Festive animated adventure, with the voices of Bobby Moynihan, Sasheer Zamata and Judah Friedlander(n).(n)</desc>

Big Bird realises he's forgotten to tell Santa that he's staying at The Furchester Hotel for Christmas and is worried that Santa won't know where to deliver his presents. Elmo and the other guests haven't told Santa either and become really worried. Will Santa know where to deliver their presents? It's too late to get a letter to the North Pole, so the Furchesters try to distract all the guests with their Christmas activities. However, every mention of Santa makes everyone worried again, they don't finish any of the activities they started. And Phoebe is disappointed that she can't enjoy her Christmas the way the Furchesters planned it. With the help of Harvey P Dull, Elmo and Big Bird realise there's more to Christmas than presents, and that sharing traditions and celebrating together is what makes Christmas so special.(n)</desc>
