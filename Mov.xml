    <sub-title lang="en">Spelling Bee</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone is excited to learn that the annual Spelling Bee final will be between Cackle's and Pentangle's, with the exceptions of Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Out of Bounds</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The end of year exams are looming and Maud's annoyed that distracted Mildred isn't taking revision seriously. Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her.</desc>

She shows us how the surface tension of water changes when we add soap and how we can stop bubbles from bursting with our hands, and using her slow-motion camera, she shows how bubbles make a sphere shape. Next, Maddie heads to a factory where a party favourite is made - chocolate! We learn how chocolate starts out as a fruit, and we see the chocolates being made for an assortment box. Maddie also uses her special camera to see the super-fast robots that put the different chocolates into the right holes in their boxes.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Go Jetters have travelled to Horsetail Fall in the Yosemite National Park. It's a 300m-high waterfall made of melted snow. Once a year the setting sun lights up the water, making it glow like fire for just a few special minutes. This is called Firefall, and if there isn't enough water from the melting snow, Firefall doesn't happen. Unfortunately, Grandmaster Glitch has built a snow princess at the top of the fall and is using an ice machine to stop her melting. When the Go Jetters arrive to watch Firefall, they see that there is no water falling down! Can the team save snowy Princess Glorinda and Firefall?</desc>

The Grimbots melt the ice around Cuddles, and Glitch then uses Grim HQ to pull up the massive chunk of ice and carry it into the air. The Go Jetters are also in Ilulissat trying to spot some whales. They learn that Ilulissat means iceberg and that an iceberg is a huge chunk of ice which forms on land and then breaks off into the sea. Just then, Glitch's heavy iceberg falls from Grim HQ and starts sliding down the hill towards the town. The Go Jetters need to stop it and protect the town!</desc>

With the help of an engineer and her special cameras, Maddie show us how the gears and weights are controlled by a computer. Next, it's time for lift-off as Maddie heads to a space museum. We see how a spacesuit is made from lots of different layers of special materials to keep astronauts safe when they are working in space, and Maddie uses her special thermal camera to see how the suit keeps astronauts warm.</desc>

In the spring the reindeer go on a very long journey called migration and as part of this journey they catch a ferry to take them to their warmer summer home. Grandmaster Glitch and the Grimbots are also in Norway, but their Grimbler scares the migrating reindeer and some of them run away from the herd. The Go Jetters need to keep them calm and get them back to the herd so they can finish their migration.</desc>

Using her special microscope camera, Maddie shows us how a pixel can make any colour from just three coloured lights - red, blue and green. Next she visits a factory where carpet is made. Maddie follows the journey that wool takes, from shearing a sheep to going through the factory, to end up in the carpets we have at home. Maddie uses her special slow-motion camera to show us how the different coloured threads are woven together on a loom to make a carpet.(n)</desc>
