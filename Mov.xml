Badania wykazały zmianę na siatkówce, którą trzeba usunąć operacyjnie. Pielęgniarka postanawia poddać się zabiegowi. Ewa przybywa do szpitala w towarzystwie córki Luizy. Czeka ją szybki zabieg, który poprzedza szereg dodatkowych badań kontrolnych. Te z kolei wykazują, że oprócz problemów z siatkówką występuje u niej zaćma. Lekarze przeprowadzą dwa zabiegi. Wkrótce czeka ją badanie kontrolne, które wykaże, czy zabieg powiódł się i nie ma komplikacji</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Czarny Kwiat</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Oparta na faktach opowieść o Haraldzie Edelstamie (Michael Nyqvist), szwedzkim ambasadorze w Chile, który we wrześniu 1973 roku podjął heroiczne działania dla ochrony ludności cywilnej. Również po tych dramatycznych wydarzeniach dyplomata nie zaprzestał walki o prawa człowieka. Jego działania sprawiły, że przez lata borykał się z własnymi demonami. Akcja filmu rozpoczyna się w chwili, gdy wydaje się, że również w życiu osobistym Haralda zapanuje wreszcie spokój. Choć uratował już setki - a być może nawet tysiące - ludzi, musi raz jeszcze podjąć walkę, by ocalić swoją dopiero co odnalezioną miłość. Jej życiu zagraża wyrok śmierci wydany przez bezlitosną władzę</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Płatny zabójca Viktor (Luke Goss) urodził się w Rumunii, gdzie dorastał w ubogiej okolicy. Mężczyzna rozpoczął współpracę z lokalną mafią, by odmienić swoje życie. Został doskonale wyszkolony na profesjonalnego mordercę przez bezwzględnego Siergieja (Danny Midwinter). Pewnego dnia jednak boss Traffikant (Stephen Marcus) wydaje na niego wyrok. Viktor postanawia upozorować własną śmierć i wyjechać z kraju. Udaje się do Londynu, gdzie ponownie trafia do przestępczego półświatka. Jednym z jego zadań jest zlikwidowanie pięknej Bethesdy (Caroline Tillette). Nieoczekiwanie mężczyzna zakochuje się ze wzajemnością w swojej niedoszłej ofierze. Od tej pory pragnie porzucić swoją krwawą profesję i rozpocząć nowe życie u boku ciężarnej partnerki. Szybko przekonuje się jednak, że nie tak łatwo uwolnić się o przeszłości</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Czarny Kwiat</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Oparta na faktach opowieść o Haraldzie Edelstamie (Michael Nyqvist), szwedzkim ambasadorze w Chile, który we wrześniu 1973 roku podjął heroiczne działania dla ochrony ludności cywilnej. Również po tych dramatycznych wydarzeniach dyplomata nie zaprzestał walki o prawa człowieka. Jego działania sprawiły, że przez lata borykał się z własnymi demonami. Akcja filmu rozpoczyna się w chwili, gdy wydaje się, że również w życiu osobistym Haralda zapanuje wreszcie spokój. Choć uratował już setki - a być może nawet tysiące - ludzi, musi raz jeszcze podjąć walkę, by ocalić swoją dopiero co odnalezioną miłość. Jej życiu zagraża wyrok śmierci wydany przez bezlitosną władzę</desc>

Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>
