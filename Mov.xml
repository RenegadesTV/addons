The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Brothers In Arms</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Dad and Amber are back together - and Amber's moving in. It's only temporary, until they find a bigger place, but the resulting chaos drives Millie, Lauren, Fran and Jake round to Mum's. And Millie has an ulterior motive: getting Craig to look after the hyper Jake as revenge for his annoying behaviour. She thinks it'll teach him to be a better brother - but Jake thinks Craig is pretty cool as he is, and starts imitating his teenage ways. Back in the confusion of the crowded flat, Dad's new website is bringing in lots of work, but his Post-It based filing system has a major weakness: gusts of wind.(n)</desc>
