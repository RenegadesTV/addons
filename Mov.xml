Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Francuski serial kryminalny opowiadający o pracy w wydziale paryskiej policji, który specjalizuje się w poszukiwaniu sprawców morderstw. Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Ładunkiem interesuje się terrorysta Damian Blake. Obaj mężczyźni nigdy się spotkali, co Frank z pomocą agentów wywiadu próbuje wykorzystać, podszywając się pod zamachowca. Podstęp się udaje. Centrum dowodzenia Tiena znajduje się w jednej z chińskich restauracji i fałszywy Blake bez problemu się tam dostaje. Gdy jednak zbliża się moment transakcji, sprawy się komplikują. Okazuje się, że zarówno w szeregach mafii, jak i wśród agentów FBI działają szpiedzy, którzy mogą udaremnić całą akcję</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

Kierowca dostarcza kobietę na lotnisko, skąd Rose ma się udać do Brazylii. Na pokładzie samolotu okazuje się, że Frank zdradził Zachary'emu plany swojej klientki. Dziewięć miesięcy później obecny zleceniodawca, Charles Gagnon, zostaje aresztowany podczas transportu. Wkrótce policja przepytuje kierowcę w sprawie niedawnego zaginięcia Rose. Wtedy Caterina Boldieu i Jules Faroux natrafiają na sfałszowane wiadomości, które Frank miał rzekomo wysyłać do kobiety. Odkrywają, że Rose z pomocą Gagnona próbuje wrobić transportera we własne porwanie</desc>

Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie</desc>

Lekarka chce dobrze wypaść przed Markiem. Prowadzący badania doktor Sandstorm ignoruje poważne efekty uboczne, które wywołuje nowe lekarstwo. W efekcie Gretchen musi ratować nie tylko siebie, lecz także 20 innych osób, które uczestniczyły w eksperymencie. Jedynie doktor Kaan uważa, że Haase wygląda idealnie i nie musi nic zmieniać.

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

Back in the confusion of the crowded flat, Dad's new website is bringing in lots of work, but his Post-It based filing system has a major weakness: gusts of wind</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Episode One, as well as meeting some of the year 7s we will get to know throughout the series, we meet newcomer Easa, who not only doesn't speak a word of English, but has never been to school before. What exactly does a head teacher do all day? Taylor Jay and Charlie find out as they investigate on a mission to write and photograph a report for the school website. They are both shocked to discover that their headteacher, Mr French, starts his school day at 6am and he expects Taylor Jay and Charlie to turn up at the same time so they can experience for themselves the long hours which are his routine. It isn't long before Taylor Jay is yawning her way through her classes!(n)</desc>
