    <desc lang="en">Without adopting the romantic and moralistic cliches that have crippled many other films about addiction, Gus Van Sant directs Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, James Le Gros and Heather Graham in one of the most influential films of the late 1980s. Bob (Dillon) is the leader of a small gang of junkies that robs pharmacies and hospitals for prescription drugs. Alas, Bob is now starting to feel the burden of responsibility as he watches over his band of misfits. Van Sant's joyous and exhilarating second feature is notable for its humor and bravery.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ever fancied being a Pilot? Join our rookies Akshita and Sam along with presenter Alex Riley as they take off into the world of aviation. Our aspiring young aircrew get their first opportunity to actually fly a plane as they are catapulted into the skies high above the peak district in a glider. They then head for Manchester to meet an airline pilot who shows them just what is needed to fly a passenger jet and lets them fly a professional simulator as used to train real pilots! Finally what they have always dreamed of happens - they take to the skies in a small aircraft with mentor Tony who puts them through their paces handling a twin engine plane. And then they get to fly it themselves, actually taking control of the plane high above the ground! Impressive!</desc>

It's only temporary, until they find a bigger place, but the resulting chaos drives Millie, Lauren, Fran and Jake round to Mum's. And Millie has an ulterior motive: getting Craig to look after the hyper Jake as revenge for his annoying behaviour. She thinks it'll teach him to be a better brother - but Jake thinks Craig is pretty cool as he is, and starts imitating his teenage ways. Back in the confusion of the crowded flat, Dad's new website is bringing in lots of work, but his Post-It based filing system has a major weakness: gusts of wind.(n)</desc>
