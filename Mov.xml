W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar.

W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy.

Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"(n)</desc>

The Twirlywoos set all the hoops spinning at the same time, the Hooter calls them back to The Big Red Boat - The teacher re-enters the school hall with 5 children, they are excited to see all the hoops spinning at once. The Robot visits the Twirlywoos. Chickedy and Chick turn the key on the robot's head - which makes the Robot spin. Great BigHoo turns the Robot's key - the Robot flies around The Big Red Boat spinning as he goes. The Twirlywoos catch hold of the Robot and they too fly and spin around The Big Red Boat</desc>
