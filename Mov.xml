    <desc lang="en">Community on Solid Ground is a youth centre in Whalley Range. Before its current management took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common. That has dropped by 73 per cent since Community on Solid Ground came along, the kids can hang out, play sports and have a place to go that means they aren't hanging around the streets. Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics. Presented by Mark Wright and Lauren Layfield.(n)</desc>

In Russia, seven-year-old Liza picks blueberries with her grandma - and helps turn them into delicious pancakes. In Ghana, Tyra, who's five, goes to the market with her mum and learns how to do the shopping. And in Jordan, Hamza, who's eight, has a day out in town with his dad, and buys a lovely present for his baby sister, Mimi. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.</desc>

Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line.(n)</desc>
