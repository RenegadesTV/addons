    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A guided tour by 16-year-old Syrian boy, Ahmed, through one of the biggest refugee camps in the world - Zaatari in Jordan. Ahmed is like any other boy his age, except he's had to leave everything behind, including his toys and technology, to move to the refugee camp. Life in Zaatari is nothing compared to home. When the Syrian civil war began in 2012 his family had to abandon their affluent lives and flee across the border to Zaatari camp with thousands of others for safety. Now living in a storage container for a home after his house was destroyed in the civil war, he has lived in Zaatari for three years, along with 80,000 other refugees, who can't leave the camp without permission. Despite their camp having everything they need, from shops to a hospital, school and football pitches, life is very different to how it was before. Ahmed doesn't let this affect his positivity though, and he finds new ways to have fun with his friends - even if it is in a desert sandstorm followed by flooding. As Ahmed cycles around the five mile square camp he introduces some of the other inspirational children who live there and reveals the reality of life in a refugee camp from a child's unique point of view.</desc>

It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?.(n)</desc>

It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?.(n)</desc>

Finally what they have always dreamed of happens - they take to the skies in a small aircraft with mentor Tony who puts them through their paces handling a twin engine plane. And then they get to fly it themselves, actually taking control of the plane high above the ground! Impressive!.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's just another day at the Furchester Hotel, that is until the Furball, a bouncing furry monster ball, arrives in a flurry of bouncing and chanting! Soon all the Furchesters are jumping and chanting 'Furball!' too. Elmo asks why they are all shouting 'Furball' and Furgus says that it's because the Furball has arrived, it's the best game ever, whenever he turns up at the hotel they all play a game of 'Furball', he's very excited and goes to get his Furball equipment bag and everything is there except his Furball shoes. Furgus and Funella go to look for his shoes and tell Phoebe and Elmo to keep an eye on the Furball and not let him out of their sight. Just at that moment, the Furball disappears, only for them to spot him up on the balcony, they're soon chasing him all over the hotel. Phoebe decides to look in her Dad's Furball bag and finds a Furball net, they hear boinging and get ready to pounce, but they catch a very suspicious looking rabbit instead. Cookie Monster then comes along and tells them to use Furball bait - a cookie! They put the cookie in the Furball net and wait, but instead of catching a Furball they catch Cookie Monster instead, with which he remembers that cookies are Cookie Monster bait, not Furball bait.(n)</desc>
