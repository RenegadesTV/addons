    <desc lang="en">Coroner Tommy Tilden and son Austin run a morgue and crematorium in Virginia. When the local sheriff brings in a body found in the basement of a home, it seems like just another open-and-shut case. As the autopsy proceeds however, they are left reeling as the inspection brings new revelations. Perfectly preserved on the outside, Jane Doe seems to have been the victim of a horrific ritualistic torture. Tommy and Austin begin to piece together these gruesome discoveries, as an unnatural force takes hold of the crematorium.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ben Affleck takes over the role of hero CIA agent Jack Ryan in this box office hit based on the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy. Low-level analyst Ryan is elevated to prominence by his expertise on an obscure strongman (Ciaran Hinds) after the politician's surprising ascendancy to the Russian presidency. But that's just the tip of a very large, very lethal iceberg involving neo-Nazis and a nuclear warhead smuggled into the U.S. by terrorists. Morgan Freeman, Bridget Moynihan and Liev Schreiber costar in this espionage adventure.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

Our aspiring young aircrew get their first opportunity to actually fly a plane as they are catapulted into the skies high above the peak district in a glider. They then head for Manchester to meet an airline pilot who shows them just what is needed to fly a passenger jet and lets them fly a professional simulator as used to train real pilots! Finally what they have always dreamed of happens - they take to the skies in a small aircraft with mentor Tony who puts them through their paces handling a twin engine plane. And then they get to fly it themselves, actually taking control of the plane high above the ground! Impressive!(n)</desc>
