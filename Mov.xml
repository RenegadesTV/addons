Niespodziankę tę przygotowała dla nich Karolina, uczestniczka programu, która zawodowo zajmuje się pokazami mody. Metamorfozą bohaterów zajmie się stylista Björn Svenson. Każdy z pacjentów prof. Paśnika przeszedł zabieg zmniejszenia żołądka. Najmłodszy z nich, Emil, schudł już 70 kg, a jego mama Ela zmieniła się nie do poznania. Z kolei Ola, której ubyło 28 kg, cieszy się, że teraz łatwiej jej uprawiać sport. Bożenie, mamie Oli, bardzo poprawiły się wyniki badań. Galę pokazu mody w wykonaniu uczestników poprowadzi Artur, który przeszedł operację 1,5 roku temu i schudł 55 kg</desc>

Chcąc poznać powody jego decyzji, umawia się z nim na lancz. W wyniku przekrętów jednego z klientów Bingum grozi usunięcie z listy adwokackiej. Do momentu ogłoszenia wyroku przez sąd może jednak pracować w zawodzie. Postanawia zająć się sprawą ośmioletniej Jackie Williams i jej matki, Wandy. Dziewczynka musi jak najszybciej poddać się operacji serca, w przeciwnym razie umrze. Firma ubezpieczeniowa nie chce jednak wypłacić pieniędzy z funduszu, zasłaniając się procedurami. Ze względu na pogarszający się stan zdrowia dziecka, proces rozpoczyna się jeszcze tego samego dnia</desc>

Nastolatek bardzo chce iść w ślady swego ojca, który niegdyś był mistrzem stanu w tej dyscyplinie sportu. Po jego śmierci tradycję rodzinną kultywował starszy brat Cala, Mike (John Cena). Jednak jego kariera szybko legła w gruzach. Mimo to właśnie do niego nastolatek zgłasza się z prośbą o pomoc w treningach. Przydatne okazują się także rady sąsiada w dojrzałym wieku. Wyboru Cala nie akceptuje jednak jego matka, Sharon (Patricia Clarkson)</desc>

Paśnika przeszedł zabieg zmniejszenia żołądka. Najmłodszy z nich, Emil, schudł już 70 kg, a jego mama Ela zmieniła się nie do poznania.

    <desc lang="en">Ed Petrie and his CBBC mates go on an adventure to find the most unusual and amazing places in Asia. And this time it's all the Main Events in one show! They take part in a belly button festival, a giant sandal race and wooden washtub challenge in Japan; ride in tuk-tuk taxis in Sri Lanka; give it pedalo power and take part in a game of Kabaddi in India; test their Kung Fu talents in China; and show off their blowpipe skills at a tribal village in Malaysia! Ed is joined on this bonkers road trip by Cel Spellman, Chris Johnson, Naomi Wilkinson, Ben Shires, Michelle Ackerley, Victoria Cook, Johny Pitts and Inel Tomlinson - there's stuff to do in Asia that is totally ace and it turns up All Over The Place.</desc>

Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.(n)</desc>
