Rodzice stale jej powtarzali, że do niczego się nie nadaje, a życie jej nie rozpieszczało. Dziś mówi o sobie "chodzące nieszczęście". Po 18 latach odeszła bowiem od męża, który był alkoholikiem i mieszka z dwoma córkami - 15-letnią Julią i 22-letnią Judytą. Niedawno straciła jednak pracę, co jeszcze bardziej ją załamało. Mimo tego stara się być silna i stawiać czoła przeciwnościom losu. Zwłaszcza, że nie może liczyć na wsparcie dawnych znajomych, którzy się od niej odwrócili. Ilość nieszczęśliwych wydarzeń spowodowała że Agnieszka wpadła w depresję. Nie potrafi uwierzyć, że spotka ją w życiu jeszcze coś dobrego. Straciła motywację do jakiegokolwiek działania.

    <desc lang="pl">Drugi sezon serialu o najlepszym francuskim agencie wywiadu, który dowiaduje, że choruje na nowotwór mózgu. Vincent Libérati (Vincent Elbaz) rezygnuje z pracy, by spędzić pozostały mu czas w Marsylii, gdzie towarzyszą mu była żona Alexandra (Hélene Seuzaret) i córka Lola (Sarah Brannens). Vincent bierze udział w tajnych misjach. Dzięki temu zyska możliwość wzięcia udziału w eksperymentalnym leczeniu guza. Vincent i Bouly próbują porwać Valéra, by w ten sposób powstrzymać go przed rozmową z szefem. Jeżeli dojdzie do tej konfrontacji, prawdziwa tożsamość agenta może wyjść na jaw. Mężczyźnie udaje się uciec, ale w czasie pościgu rozbija się o skały i umiera. Bertrand zdołał odkryć, gdzie znajdują się pieniądze należące do Koskasa. Cała kwota została umieszczona na koncie bankowym na Bahamach, skąd wypłacił je tajemniczy nieznajomy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Długie miesiące poprzedzające ślub nie sprzyjają relaksowi. Suzy wciąż toczy wojny ze świadkiem. Tym razem kością niezgody jest przemowa. Gdy mimo próśb i gróźb zostaje wygłoszona pierwotna wersja, wzburzona panna młoda wylewa na pechowego mówcę zawartość kieliszka. To nie koniec. Suzy powoli się rozkręca. Gdy 4-letnia siostra narzeczonego zakłada ślubny diadem, kobieta wpada w szał. Zdziera go jej z głowy niemal z włosami... Z nietypowymi problemami boryka się Brittany, która bardziej skupia się na ślubnych przygotowaniach niż na fakcie, że odtąd ona i jej partner będą małżeństwem. W imię wyższych celów para zapożycza się i wyprzedaje wszelkie ruchomości. Głównym źródłem finansowania zbliżającej się ceremonii staje się... loteria. Nic dziwnego, że nawet najmniejsze problemy finansowe, stawiają ich ślub pod znakiem zapytania(n)</desc>

Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać. Trener personalny i terapeutka Joanna Godecka podpowiedzą jej co zrobić, aby na nowo otworzyć się na świat i ludzi(n)</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Długie miesiące poprzedzające ślub nie sprzyjają relaksowi. Suzy wciąż toczy wojny ze świadkiem. Tym razem kością niezgody jest przemowa. Gdy mimo próśb i gróźb zostaje wygłoszona pierwotna wersja, wzburzona panna młoda wylewa na pechowego mówcę zawartość kieliszka. To nie koniec. Suzy powoli się rozkręca. Gdy 4-letnia siostra narzeczonego zakłada ślubny diadem, kobieta wpada w szał. Zdziera go jej z głowy niemal z włosami... Z nietypowymi problemami boryka się Brittany, która bardziej skupia się na ślubnych przygotowaniach niż na fakcie, że odtąd ona i jej partner będą małżeństwem. W imię wyższych celów para zapożycza się i wyprzedaje wszelkie ruchomości. Głównym źródłem finansowania zbliżającej się ceremonii staje się... loteria. Nic dziwnego, że nawet najmniejsze problemy finansowe, stawiają ich ślub pod znakiem zapytania(n)</desc>

Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać. Trener personalny i terapeutka Joanna Godecka podpowiedzą jej co zrobić, aby na nowo otworzyć się na świat i ludzi(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Funella is very excited because it's time for the Furchester family dinner! Everyone will be heading to the dining room as soon as they've helped their guests. Mr Pickwood the beaver needs to know where some wood is, Captain Metimbers the pirate needs showing to her room and so does Matty the little mouse. With all this activity, Harvey P Dull wants to know who will look after the front desk if all the Furchesters are having a family dinner and with that Funella has moved his favourite chair in front of the desk and thanks him for helping out! The family all finally sit down for dinner, but when Furgus takes a seat he falls over. Mr Pickwood has eaten his chair! Furgus takes him to the garden and shows him the wood he CAN eat. Then Captain Metimbers interrupts, she's locked out of her treasure chest and needs Phoebe to open it. Next, Matty arrives and wants Elmo to get the bubble bath off the shelf for him as Elmo is so tall and he's so small. Then Funella hears Harvey P Dull welcoming someone WITHOUT furry arms. Funella puts some fur on Harvey's arms and shows him how to welcome guests properly. But now everyone is so busy that they can't have their family meal, it's a catastrophe! The Furchesters put their furry heads together and think, how can they have their family meal and not be interrupted by their guests? Fuzzawubba! Phoebe has a monster idea, why don't they invite their guests to dinner, after all everyone in the Furchester is like family!</desc>
