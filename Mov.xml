Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

    <desc lang="pl">Tabby postanawia sama przygotować figurki na tort weselny. Niestety całe przedsięwzięcie kończy się fiaskiem. To jednak nie koniec rozczarowań. Okazuje się bowiem, że wykonana na ostatnią chwilę przymiarka sukni także nie przebiega zgodnie z planem. Cały swój gniew Tabby skupia na bogu ducha winnym narzeczonym, Billym. Co więcej, mimo że do ceremonii zostały zaledwie trzy dni, rezygnuje z dalszych przygotowań. W tym samym czasie Christine kłóci się z narzeczonym Aaronem o to, co jeszcze muszą zrobić przed ślubem. Panna młoda marzy o wypoczynku, a gdy to okazuje się niemożliwe, sięga po alkohol. Pijana i zmęczona ukochana zmienia życie Aarona w prawdziwe piekło(n)</desc>

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

W Norwegi zamierzają nakręcić własną adaptację dramatu Henrika Ibsena "Oblubienica morza". Okazuje się, że z pozoru proste zadanie przerasta filmowców - w pracy przeszkadzają im surrealistyczne otoczenie oraz nigdy się niekończący dzień polarny. Wszystko to dodatkowo zaostrza dzielące grupę konflikty. Niecodzienne warunki mają też wpływ zarówno na samych artystów, jak i tworzone przez nich dzieło. Po licznych wzlotach i upadkach udaje im się z sukcesem ukończyć pracę nad filmem(n)</desc>

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek.

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Na motywach sztuki słynnego norweskiego dramatopisarza. Grupa ośmiu brytyjskich aktorów wraz z cierpiącym na narkolepsję reżyserem udaje się na pole podbiegunowe. W Norwegi zamierzają nakręcić własną adaptację dramatu Henrika Ibsena "Oblubienica morza". Okazuje się, że z pozoru proste zadanie przerasta filmowców - w pracy przeszkadzają im surrealistyczne otoczenie oraz nigdy się niekończący dzień polarny. Wszystko to dodatkowo zaostrza dzielące grupę konflikty. Niecodzienne warunki mają też wpływ zarówno na samych artystów, jak i tworzone przez nich dzieło. Po licznych wzlotach i upadkach udaje im się z sukcesem ukończyć pracę nad filmem(n)</desc>

Unfortunately it clashes with a rare comet sighting, which Martha and Ollie are desperate to experience. They have even been allowed to borrow the very precious school telescope for the evening. Ollie is smuggled in to Lily's house by Martha to watch secretly from the attic, with Martha planning to split her time between both events. After much chaos and confusion, and with the presence of Ollie in the house rumbled, a compromise is finally reached, where the girls all get to do both the make-over and watch the rare comet. At the end of the make-over session Martha and Jas are horrified to see Lily has transformed herself to look exactly like Greta in a bid to impress Matt. To spare Lily's feelings they pretend to like her new look, but are relieved the next day in school to see Lily returned to her normal, natural self. Lily has realised it's better to be yourself, rather than try and change who you are just to please others(n)</desc>
