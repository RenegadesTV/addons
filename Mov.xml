The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line</desc>

Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit(n)</desc>
