    <sub-title lang="pl">Rodzina Allcocków</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Obserwujemy rodzinę z Birmingham, która jest zachęcana do zmiany swoich nawyków żywieniowych dla dobra dzieci. Lisa i Royston mieszkają w Birmingham razem z synem Michaelem oraz trzema córkami. Rodzina ma trzy tygodnie, aby radykalnie odmienić swoje życie. Dorośli muszą dopilnować, aby ich pociechy wcześnie chodziły spać. Niewyspane dzieci mają następnego dnia problemy z koncentracją. Gotowe jedzenie zastąpić powinny posiłki przygotowywane w domowej kuchni. Dzieci muszą też nauczyć się jeździć na rowerze i regularnie ćwiczyć(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Profil</title>
    <sub-title lang="pl">Profil (odc. 5)</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Francuski serial kryminalny opowiadający o pracy w wydziale paryskiej policji, który specjalizuje się w poszukiwaniu sprawców morderstw. Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"(n)</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred</desc>

Joe has been profoundly deaf since he was a baby and a specially trained hearing dog could bring him the independence and confidence he so craves. Only 30 children in the UK have one of these dogs and Joe is next on the waiting list, but his journey isn't straightforward. Joe also has a Titanium leg and needs an operation to help him walk before he can receive his dog. Can Joe fully recover from his surgery and complete the training that will allow him to have a new best friend - his very own hearing dog?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">RANK THE PRANK - pranking Hollywood style! Today our pesky pranksters are Dukafundis (Markus and Ellysa) and 'Very Intelligent Pranksters' (Evan and Ashazia) who team up with digital effects wizard Hassan Aziz and SFX specialists Marc Reichel and Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. The teams take over a bowling alley and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's strike three for the targets when Markus and Ellysa's 'Haunted Alley' dukes it out with Evan and Ashazia's 'Hotdog Bowler'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, the effectors have planned the ultimate MEGA PRANK at a car wash featuring a dirty car, a nervous driver and a meteor shower! Our 'target' may be able to avoid the meteor but will mom's car be able to do the same? One thing's for sure, this explosively entertaining mega prank strikes comedy gold!(n)</desc>
