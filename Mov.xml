    <desc lang="en">In 1969, there's trouble brewing on the Paris set of the cartoon sexpionage saga "Dragonfly." After firing the film's arty auteur (Gerard Depardieu), its Italian producer (Giancarlo Giannini) gives the reins to a young American filmmaker (Jeremy Davis) who has been shooting his own film diary while abroad. Now he is faced with coming up with a new ending for "Dragonfly," while coping with the distractions of his sultry leading lady (Angela Lindvall). In his feature debut, Roman Coppola recreates a loving tribute to the world of late '60s pop.</desc>

Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In today's episode, Maddie is relaxing at home, playing games and watching television. She shows us how a television screen works using millions of tiny squares called pixels. Using her special microscope camera, Maddie shows us how a pixel can make any colour from just three coloured lights - red, blue and green. Next she visits a factory where carpet is made. Maddie follows the journey that wool takes, from shearing a sheep to going through the factory, to end up in the carpets we have at home. Maddie uses her special slow-motion camera to show us how the different coloured threads are woven together on a loom to make a carpet.</desc>
