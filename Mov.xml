    <desc lang="en">Part 1 of two: The Kyles are vacationing in the Bahamas and Michael just wants to relax by the pool. Not likely. For starters, an annoying acquaintance (David Alan Grier) shows up. Then Jr. and Vanessa fight because he wants to shirk his parental responsibilities. And Franklin's “archenemy,” Franceso Mumfordi, is on the island. (repeat)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Conclusion. Michael and Jay are stranded on a remote island with the annoying guy (David Alan Grier) that Michael had blown off. Too bad: he's a survivalist, and he won't help them. Meanwhile, Claire discovers that there's alcohol in those Coco Mocos that she has been eating; Jr. takes “time off from my responsibilities” with his new friend, Dave (Marcus Patric); and Franklin confronts his “bubbleganger” (as Kady calls him), Francesco Mumfordi (Noah Gray-Cabey).

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Na motywach sztuki słynnego norweskiego dramatopisarza. Grupa ośmiu brytyjskich aktorów wraz z cierpiącym na narkolepsję reżyserem udaje się na pole podbiegunowe. W Norwegi zamierzają nakręcić własną adaptację dramatu Henrika Ibsena "Oblubienica morza". Okazuje się, że z pozoru proste zadanie przerasta filmowców - w pracy przeszkadzają im surrealistyczne otoczenie oraz nigdy się niekończący dzień polarny. Wszystko to dodatkowo zaostrza dzielące grupę konflikty. Niecodzienne warunki mają też wpływ zarówno na samych artystów, jak i tworzone przez nich dzieło. Po licznych wzlotach i upadkach udaje im się z sukcesem ukończyć pracę nad filmem</desc>

Dostała się na studia dziennikarstwa, dostała również stypendium. Nie odnalazła się jednak zupełnie w środowisku studenckim, nie miała koleżanek, czuła się samotna w związku z czym porzuciła studia. Helena ma trudności ze znalezieniem dla siebie miejsca i zajęcia. Jak sama mówi, to przez to, że się nie uśmiecha. Uważa też, że koleżanki z pracy zazdroszczą jej tego, że jest atrakcyjna.

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

W Norwegi zamierzają nakręcić własną adaptację dramatu Henrika Ibsena "Oblubienica morza". Okazuje się, że z pozoru proste zadanie przerasta filmowców - w pracy przeszkadzają im surrealistyczne otoczenie oraz nigdy się niekończący dzień polarny. Wszystko to dodatkowo zaostrza dzielące grupę konflikty. Niecodzienne warunki mają też wpływ zarówno na samych artystów, jak i tworzone przez nich dzieło. Po licznych wzlotach i upadkach udaje im się z sukcesem ukończyć pracę nad filmem</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek.

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>
