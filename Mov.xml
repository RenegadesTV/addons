    <desc lang="pl">Prezentacja prawdziwych, najczęściej wykonywanych w Polsce, zabiegów chirurgicznych. Tu nie ma miejsca na scenariusz. Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Młody mężczyzna został pchnięty nożem. Lekarze, by go ratować, decydują się na nowatorski zabieg wszczepienia zastawki trójdzielnej - to druga taka operacja w historii polskiej kardiochirurgii</desc>

Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę(n)</desc>

Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Młody mężczyzna został pchnięty nożem. Lekarze, by go ratować, decydują się na nowatorski zabieg wszczepienia zastawki trójdzielnej - to druga taka operacja w historii polskiej kardiochirurgii</desc>
