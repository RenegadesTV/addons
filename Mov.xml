Iona and grandad James dress up in clothes from the time known as the Highland Clearances. They learn about a boy called Lachlan and why he, and many other families, had to leave their homes and move to a new country. Together they discover what life was like for Lachlan in Scotland - where he would live, the language he spoke, the food he would have eaten and the jobs he would do to help his family. Iona and grandad James then visit an American township to see how different Lachlan's new life in America would have been and they try their hand at panning for gold.</desc>
