    <desc lang="en">Conclusion. Elvis returns home after his Army discharge, when he was still a huge star and making hit records, but faces a rapidly changing pop-music scene. Meanwhile, Col. Parker's efforts to pair Elvis with the likes of Frank Sinatra on TV ensure a long and lucrative mainstream career; and Presely spends a seven-year period making a string of lightweight, music-infused movies, which stunted his musical growth and alienated many fans.
