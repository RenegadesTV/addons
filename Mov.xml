    <desc lang="en">A Times Square apple peddler, who's long pretended to be a socialite in letters to her daughter in Europe, learns the young lady is coming to New York with her fiancé, so the mother recruits her streetwise pals to help pass her off as a wealthy dowager. Director Frank Capra's version of a Damon Runyon tale was nominated for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay and Actress (May Robson as the wannabe dowager), and Capra remade the movie in 1961 as "Pocketful of Miracles."
