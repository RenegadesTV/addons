A corruption so pervasive it will turn men into rats.

    <desc lang="en">Drew Barrymore enchants as a Chicago newspaper editor who relives her hellish teen years while on an undercover assignment at a local high school. Barrymore's great, but the film celebrates the fact that her character wins over the same type of “in crowd” that taunted her as a teen. David Arquette costars as her cool brother. Raja Gosnell is the director, and Barrymore served as executive producer. (repeat) (cc).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Family comedy adapted from David Walliams' children's book about 12-year-old Dennis, an ordinary boy who lives in an ordinary town - but somehow feels different from everyone else. A chance sighting in a fashion magazine introduces him to a whole new world of colour and creativity. But can a boy really wear a dress - and what will his headmaster, dad and friends in the football team think if they find out? Billy Kennedy stars as Dennis, with a supporting cast including Jennifer Saunders, Tim McInnerny, Meera Syal, Steve Speirs, Felicity Montagu, James Buckley and Walliams himself, with a cameo appearance by supermodel Kate Moss.</desc>

Determined to stay in 'showbiz', he invests his last few dollars in setting up a TV Channel, number 6597423 in the listings. With a brand new channel and nothing to put on it, Larry then makes the classic mistake of employing Diddy Dick and Dom to take charge of programming. Diddy Dick and Dom have launched their very own TV channel!

    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Schoolboy Ben is bored witless after being made to stay with his grandma. All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Community Den</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Community on Solid Ground is a youth centre in Whalley Range. Before its current management took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common. That has dropped by 73 per cent since Community on Solid Ground came along, the kids can hang out, play sports and have a place to go that means they aren't hanging around the streets. Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics. Presented by Mark Wright and Lauren Layfield.(n)</desc>
