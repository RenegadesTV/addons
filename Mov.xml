    <title lang="en">Mr Stink</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Twelve-year-old Chloe leads a lonely existence - her mother is too busy with her political ambitions to take any interest in her daughter, her hen-pecked dad is hiding a secret of his own and she cannot hope to compete with her `perfect' younger sister - to say nothing of the nasty girls who make her school life a misery. So when she meets a tramp in need of somewhere to stay, she invites him to hide in her family's garden shed - but it soon turns out there is more to her smelly guest than meets the eye. Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville stars, with Sheridan Smith, Johnny Vegas and Isabella Blake-Thomas, and an appearance from Britain's Got Talent winner Pudsey the dog.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this programme we visit three children who are all having a fascinating day out. In Russia, seven-year-old Liza picks blueberries with her grandma - and helps turn them into delicious pancakes. In Ghana, Tyra, who's five, goes to the market with her mum and learns how to do the shopping. And in Jordan, Hamza, who's eight, has a day out in town with his dad, and buys a lovely present for his baby sister, Mimi. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>
