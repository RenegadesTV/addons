Those featured include 39-year-old Georgina, who was once a frumpy mum but has now followed daughter Kayla by becoming the image of a Barbie doll, complete with fake boobs and lips. Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?(n)</desc>

Jest zwykłą dziewczyną, która robi karierę medyczną i musi walczyć z porywami serca. Jej osobowość i urok osobisty przyciąga do niej mężczyzn jak magnes. Kolejny raz doktor Haase przeżywa miłosne rozterki. Dla odmiany jednak wszystkie znaki na niebie i ziemi wskazują tylko jednego mężczyznę, na którego widok serce Gretchen bije mocniej. Obiekt jej westchnień jest dla niej niestety nieosiągalny i lekarka powoli oswaja się z porażką. Tymczasem do szpitala trafia była wychowawczyni przedszkolna, pani Schnippel. Kobieta miała nieszczęśliwy wypadek. Okazuje się, że starsza pani zna wstydliwy sekret doktora Meiera jeszcze z czasów dzieciństwa(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

Problemy zaczynają się od przymiarki strojów, które niestety nie leżą jak ulał. Później jest już tylko gorzej. Siostra ogłasza, że jest w ciąży, co zdaniem Kim było ukartowane, by umniejszyć jej rolę na weselu, rodzina zapada na grypę żołądkową, a brat spóźnia się pięć minut na ceremonię. To wystarcza, by Kim wpadła w histerię. Z kolei Danielle wykreśla swoją kuzynkę z listy gości wesela za krytyczne uwagi na temat sukni ślubnej. Podczas wieczoru panieńskiego dopuszcza się tylu bezeceństw, że nawet jej 20- letnia córka czuje się zakłopotana. Apogeum następuje podczas sesji zdjęciowej, podczas której Danielle zaczyna awanturować się z fotografami(n)</desc>

Następnie przeprowadzają stymulację pokazującą, jak będzie się zmieniał ich stan zdrowia w ciągu najbliższych kilkunastu czy nawet kilkudziesięciu lat. Wyniki są zastraszające - dzieciom często grozi nie tylko nadwaga, ale też cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Na podstawie zebranych informacji zespół ekspertów przygotowuje plan działania, który ma pomóc rodzinom zmienić złe nawyki i odmienić bieg wydarzeń. Od rodziców zależy, czy zastosują się do wskazówek specjalistów(n)</desc>

Obiekt jej westchnień jest dla niej niestety nieosiągalny i lekarka powoli oswaja się z porażką. Tymczasem do szpitala trafia była wychowawczyni przedszkolna, pani Schnippel.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

Problemy zaczynają się od przymiarki strojów, które niestety nie leżą jak ulał. Później jest już tylko gorzej. Siostra ogłasza, że jest w ciąży, co zdaniem Kim było ukartowane, by umniejszyć jej rolę na weselu, rodzina zapada na grypę żołądkową, a brat spóźnia się pięć minut na ceremonię. To wystarcza, by Kim wpadła w histerię. Z kolei Danielle wykreśla swoją kuzynkę z listy gości wesela za krytyczne uwagi na temat sukni ślubnej. Podczas wieczoru panieńskiego dopuszcza się tylu bezeceństw, że nawet jej 20- letnia córka czuje się zakłopotana. Apogeum następuje podczas sesji zdjęciowej, podczas której Danielle zaczyna awanturować się z fotografami(n)</desc>

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

Przestała wychodzić z domu i spotykać się ze znajomymi, nie mówiąc o tym, że nie ma nawet czasu, by zadbać o siebie czy zatroszczyć się o swoje dobre samopoczucie. Agata jest też nieśmiała, czuje strach przed nawiązywaniem nowych kontaktów. Niebawem będzie musiała też wrócić do pracy, co wywołuje w niej mnóstwo obaw.

Następnie przeprowadzają stymulację pokazującą, jak będzie się zmieniał ich stan zdrowia w ciągu najbliższych kilkunastu czy nawet kilkudziesięciu lat. Wyniki są zastraszające - dzieciom często grozi nie tylko nadwaga, ale też cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Na podstawie zebranych informacji zespół ekspertów przygotowuje plan działania, który ma pomóc rodzinom zmienić złe nawyki i odmienić bieg wydarzeń.
