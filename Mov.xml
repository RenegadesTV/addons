    <desc lang="en">Otto and Anna Quangel (Brendan Gleeson &amp; Emma Thompson) are a working-class husband and wife doing their best to ride out the war in Berlin in 1940. When their son is killed fighting on the frontlines however, everything changes. They begin pouring their rage and grief into postcards emblazoned with anti-Nazi slogans, risking everything to get their messages of protest across the city. This seemingly small act of subversion rattles the regime, including a police inspector (Daniel Brühl) who will not rest until the culprits have been caught.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In today's episode, Maddie is having a party! She finds out how bubbles work when we blow into bubble mixture. She shows us how the surface tension of water changes when we add soap and how we can stop bubbles from bursting with our hands, and using her slow-motion camera, she shows how bubbles make a sphere shape. Next, Maddie heads to a factory where a party favourite is made - chocolate! We learn how chocolate starts out as a fruit, and we see the chocolates being made for an assortment box. Maddie also uses her special camera to see the super-fast robots that put the different chocolates into the right holes in their boxes.</desc>

Preschool drama series about children living on an extraordinary inner-city estate. David is super-excited at the prospect of writing a poem for the Apple Tree community poetry event. As David tries to write about his trains, he also tries to convince his friend Laila to take part too, but no matter how hard he tries, Laila remains determined not to participate. Eventually David, with Grandma Zainab's help, works out that Laila's problem isn't stage fright but more to do with her difficulties with reading.

Using her special microscope camera, Maddie shows us how a pixel can make any colour from just three coloured lights - red, blue and green. Next she visits a factory where carpet is made. Maddie follows the journey that wool takes, from shearing a sheep to going through the factory, to end up in the carpets we have at home. Maddie uses her special slow-motion camera to show us how the different coloured threads are woven together on a loom to make a carpet.(n)</desc>
