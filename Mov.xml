    <title lang="en">Bloody Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>
