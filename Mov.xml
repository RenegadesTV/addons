    <desc lang="en">Lindsay Duncan stars as Margaret Thatcher in this one-off drama charting the former prime minister's final days in office. In November 1990, deputy prime minister Geoffrey Howe resigns with a speech in which he urges his fellow Conservative Party members to consider their loyalty to Mrs Thatcher. A leadership challenge is announced, but the Iron Lady refuses to take it seriously - unaware her premiership will be over just nine days later. Ian McDiarmid portrays loyal husband Denis, with Geoffrey Howe, Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke played by John Sessions, Oliver Cotton and Kevin R McNally.(n)</desc>

The wedding plans are okay so far as Mark and Theresa's golfing-buddy dads are concerned. Alas, the couple's mothers constitute a different story: Betsy Lucas (Shelley Long) and Bridget Connolly (Patty Duke) have carried on a bitter feud for the past 25 years, and they aren't about to go into "all is forgiven" mode just because their kids are in love. The situation reaches a disastrous peak when Betsy and Bridget take it upon themselves to arrange the couple's Catalina Island wedding--and as terrifying as these two ladies are when they're on opposite sides of the fence, they're even more so when they join forces! Falling in Love with the Girl Next Door was first telecast February 4, 2006, as a cinematic Valentine card from cable's Hallmark Channel(n)</desc>

With romance in the air it's no wonder that Madge (Celia Imrie) has her pick of handsome suitors, and as stalwart Muriel safeguards the many secrets of the vivacious residents, Sonny and Sunaina learn that planning a traditional Indian wedding can be a true test of commitment</desc>

For decades, Gus Lobel (Eastwood) has been one of the best scouts in Major League Baseball. But these days his eyes just aren't what they used to be, and as a phenomenal young batter enters the draft, the owners of the Atlanta Braves cast a shadow of doubt over Gus' judgment. Meanwhile, his daughter Mickey ( Adams) is an aspiring partner at a major Atlanta law firm. In the wake of his wife's death, Gus sent Mickey away, and their relationship has been strained ever since. But she knows a thing or two about baseball, and recognizing that her father's job is in jeopardy, she decides to help him -- even at the risk of derailing her own career. Now, throwing caution to the wind (and ignoring her gruff father's objections), Mickey joins Gus for a scouting trip that could keep him in the game until he's ready to retire, as well as repair a father/daughter relationship that once seemed all but lost. Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Robert Patrick, and Matthew Lillard co-star(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film that does what it says on the tin. Samuel L. Jackson plays Neville Flynn, an FBI agent escorting Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips), a witness to a gangland slaying, from Hawaii to Los Angeles. However, the gangster, Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson), has secreted crates of venomous serpents in the cargo hold and when they're released, all hell breaks loose. The film earned a reputation for the inclusion of plot lines from blogging fans, including one now infamous line. Despite the novel approach to its production, David R Ellis's film is surprisingly well-acted and tense, with both Julianna Margulies as flight attendant Claire Miller and David Koechner as co-pilot Rick receiving a share of the cracking dialogue(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the popular cartoon character, this family-oriented "ghost story" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl (Christina Ricci). The eternally irritable Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in New England. Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house(n)</desc>

Chuckie (voice of Christine Cavanaugh) has been fretting over his father Chas (voice of Michael Bell) and his status as a single father, as he wants to have a mommy like all of his friends. Chas and his father Stu (voice of Jack Riley) were hired to create a bevy of electronic critters for the newly opened Euro-Reptarland theme park, but the robots are acting up, and park manager Coco La Bouche (Susan Sarandon) is hopping mad. So Stu and Chas are flown to Paris to do some repairs, with Chas bringing Chuckie and all his friends along. Their visit to the City of Lights proves to be one adventure after another, as Chuckie tries to find a suitable mother (with Coco leading the pack) and Tommy (voice of Elizabeth Dailey) somehow gets behind the wheel of the giant Reptar robot.

    <title lang="en">Carlito's Way</title>
    <desc lang="en">Carlito's Way is a tale of a former hood trying to escape his former life. Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a high-level Puerto Rican drug dealer sprung from a three-decade jail sentence after only five years, thanks to a technicality and his sleazy, cocaine-addled lawyer, Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Carlito renounces his previous ways and takes a job as the manager of a club that Kleinfeld has invested in, planning to save enough money so that he can eventually move to the Caribbean. But no sooner is Carlito back on the streets of New York than his old life claws at him in the form of both old partners (Luis Guzman) and vicious up-and-comers (John Leguizamo). Nevertheless, Carlito stays clean and even restarts his relationship with a dancer named Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), until he is finally led astray by Kleinfeld, who manipulates Carlito into participating in the murder of a Mafia don from whom Kleinfeld has stolen a million dollars. At that point, the race is on to see whether Carlito and Gail can escape his world for good. The film is based on two novels about Carlito written by New York State judge Edwin Torres(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Carlito's Way: Rise to Power</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this belated prequel to director Brian De Palma's 1993 crime drama, gangster Carlito Brigante (Jay Hernandez) rises through the ranks of the New York underworld to establish himself as Spanish Harlem's most powerful kingpin. As the intoxication of ultimate power tightens its firm grip on the rising heroin czar, he soon learns that greed and deception are the unspoken laws of the street. With no one to trust except for his two brothers in crime, Carlito begins building an empire founded on supplying the city's addicts with the one product that is always in demand. His dreams of ruling the city finally becoming a reality, Carlito soon learns that the only way to sustain his power is through loyalty and respect. Adapted from author Edwin Torres' acclaimed novel, Carlito's Way: Rise to Power also stars Mario Van Peebles, Luis Guzmán, and Sean Combs(n)</desc>

Agent 47 is an elite, genetically engineered assassin who takes great pride in his work. His lethal grace, steady shot, and unparalleled precision have all served to make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the world. But when the killer without a conscience is faced with an unanticipated series of developments, his entire perception of reality begins to shift. On assignment to take out Russian head of state Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), Agent 47 is caught off guard by the appearance of presidential look-alikes. When the high-profile hit captures the attention of such powerful intelligence organizations as the CIA and Interpol, agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) is dispatched to rein Agent 47 in. Meanwhile, a mysterious Russian prostitute named Nika (Olga Kurylenko) has walked into Agent 47's life, causing the methodical killer to become overwhelmed by emotions that were previously foreign to him</desc>

    <title lang="en">What Happens in Vegas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two strangers (Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher) find themselves hitched after a wild night of Las Vegas shenanigans in this 20th Century Fox comedy. Jack Fuller (Kutcher) is a single Manhattanite who can never quite commit to a permanent, long-term relationship and repeatedly hears from his lovers that he "isn't serious boyfriend material." Employed by his father (Treat Williams) at a local furniture business, Jack spends his workdays goofing off by watching sporting events behind dad's back. Joy McNally (Diaz) is faring slightly better; a young, polished urbanite, she juggles a demanding job as a trader on the NYSE with a marital engagement to the impressive Mason (Jason Sudeikis), but has modified her entire life and all of her interests to please her intended. Coincident with Mr. Fuller's decision to fire his son, Mason severs his engagement to Joy; as a result, both Jack and Joy hit the skids at around the same time and decide to cut their losses by heading out to Vegas. The two accidentally bump into one another when a computer mix-up at the hotel puts them in adjoining rooms; though they begin their acquaintanceship by bickering endlessly, they end up spending a long, drunken night on the town together, and when the sun rises and Joy comes to, she discovers that she unwittingly married Jack in the middle of the night. Alas, just when the two are about to call it quits by filing for divorce after the shortest marriage in history, Jack tosses a coin into a Vegas slot machine and hits a three-million-dollar jackpot -- which naturally pits the newlyweds against one another in an attempt to claim the full share of the money. A conservative local judge, R.D. Whopper (Dennis Miller), then adds the final twist by refusing to grant a divorce until Joy and Jack have given married life a fair shake. In time, the marrieds may just discover that this union isn't as far off the mark as they initially thought. Dennis Farina, Queen Latifah, and Zach Galifianakis round out the supporting cast</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor John Malkovich made his directorial debut with this tense political thriller, set in an unnamed Latin American nation and based on a novel by Nicholas Shakespeare. Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is a former lawyer who became a police detective as a more direct way of dealing with crime and justice. Rejas has been assigned to investigate a group of terrorists who are determined to up-end the current government through any means necessary, from revolting pranks (such as leaving dead animals, painted with revolutionary rhetoric, around the capitol building) to bombings and assassinations. Rejas knows little about the terrorists, and no one on the force is certain of the identity or whereabouts of the group's leader, who calls himself President Ezequiel. As Rejas learns more about Ezequiel and his group, they begin stepping up their actions, making his investigation all the more urgent. Meanwhile, Rejas is a man whose daughter is taking dance lessons from Yolanda (Laura Morante); as Rejas and Yolanda get to know one another, a romance begins to grow between them, but in time, Rejas begins to suspect that the woman he loves is working with the terrorists he's been trying to ferret out(n)</desc>

As this bizarre revelation sinks in, Cleveland becomes enraptured by her other-worldly charm. As he shelters her in his apartment, other inhabitants of the building begin falling into place as representations of characters from an Eastern myth in which these mermaids, or "narfs," co-exist unhappily with more beastly and violent characters. In human reality, the forces of darkness that threaten the heroes of a fairy tale prove to be much more terrifying, and the victory of good over evil is by no means guaranteed.

Eve loves PARTY and its youth leader is impressed by Eve's attitude to technology. But when Eve becomes obsessed with the idea of canoeing on the lake Will starts to get really nervous. Nick and Zac have worries of their own and attempt to listen into Mr Gwenlan's phone calls. When Mr Gwenlan turns out to be PARTY's co-founder and appears at the youth club, Will marches Eve home. Will can't understand why Eve's protocols aren't responding to danger and has strong words with Eve but she storms off. Will, Lily and Zac reach the lakeside in time to find the youth group encouraging Eve to cross the lake on a rickety raft. If Eve falls in, it would be the end of her. To make matters worse, Will can't swim but dives in to try and save Eve anyway.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Abe introduces Eve to 'basic sales techniques' getting her to help him selling mobile phones in the park. Once Eve gives the mobiles a turbo boost they start to sell like hot cakes. Abe is delighted until Eve sells a phone to Isaac, a young wheelchair user, for double the price. For Abe, a business line has been crossed - he even ends up paying Isaac to get the phone back. In another part of the business world, to protect Calimov from PRICE, Katherine has designed a new security system called Quincy. But when Quincy fails to stop a hack, Eve's secret is at risk. Eve herself is busy in the park teaching some manners to a gang of older boys, which leads Isaac to discovering something different about Eve. Isaac demands the gang's friendship in return for keeping Eve's secret. Eve's identity is under even more threat at Calimov where Nick uses Quincy's flagging power to launch a counterattack against PRICE. When Lord Hoffman arrives to pressure Katherine to back down, all seems to be lost. And with PRICE trying to hit Mary too and Adam failing to respond to her messages, Mary issues Adam with a new command - he must deal with Eve immediately.</desc>

Nick can't detect any outside interference, so Eve concludes that for her friends' safety, she must be deactivated. Will and Lily see a connection between Eve going haywire and PRICE attempting to hack into Calimov two days earlier. While Lily stalls Mr Gwenlan at a PARTY event, Will goes to his house but can't get inside. Will's call for help reactivates Eve who races out to help him. Inside Mr Gwenlan's house, Eve and Will discover more about what PRICE knows. But when Mr Gwenlan arrives home and intends to call the police, it's what Will knows that stops Mr Gwenlan in his tracks. Abe leaves hospital and is happy to forgive Eve in exchange for a new pair of trainers. Nick still can't believe that Eve caused the electric shock. And when Eve intercepts a communication between Mary and someone else - the source of the malfunction finally becomes clear.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The robotic girl investigates the identity of Adam by channelling the methods of the great Sherlock Holmes. First Eve turns her attention to Isaac. Then Eve considers if it's Cain. Lily inspects and is shocked to discover the truth about Cain and his family. When Eve develops her intuition using Sherlock's method she overloads her system. Zac suggests that she'd be better off using her own processes and Eve realises that her tests have been flawed and that Mary could have built Adam to better pass for a human. Perhaps Adam can eat or even breathe? Meanwhile, Nick and Katherine attempt to discover the robot's identity by tricking Mary into revealing Adam's location. However Mary turns the tables, leaving them back at square one. Thankfully Eve's reasoning moves along more quickly and a final imaginative leap of deduction brings Eve to her eureka moment. Eve sees that Mary's spy is an exact clone of a real person. But when Eve finds them both how can she work out who is her friend and who is the exact robot copy.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Eve is devastated by Adam being irreparably damaged. To cheer her up, Abe suggests a ghost hunt! Will and Lily think he's crazy but Eve is fascinated by the idea of ghosts - and the possibility that Adam might have one. Meanwhile, Katherine and Gwenlan concoct a plan to build giant EMP devices and remove the threat of Mary once and for all. But Nick is furious about the danger this poses to Eve and resigns from Calimov. Eve sets about finding a ghost and her behaviour becomes increasingly odd. But Eve's not the only one acting peculiarly as Abe seems intent to make everything in the house as scary as possible. When the gang do actually see 'a ghost', Zac becomes suspicious and unmasks the apparition. Disappointed, they head home but Eve and Abe spot an unearthly figure at the window of the house - maybe ghosts do exist after all.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 'My Life: The Boy on the Bicycle', we are taken on an unprecedented and fascinating guided tour by 16 year-old Syrian boy, Ahmed, through one of the biggest refugee camps in the world - Zaatari in Jordan. Ahmed is like any other boy his age, except he's had to leave everything behind, including his toys and technology, to move to the refugee camp. Life in Zaatari is nothing compared to home. When the Syrian civil war began in 2012 his family had to abandon their affluent lives and flee across the border to Zaatari camp with thousands of others for safety. Now living in a storage container for a home after his house was destroyed in the civil war, he has lived in Zaatari for three years, along with 80,000 other refugees, who can't leave the camp without permission. Despite their camp having everything they need, from shops to a hospital, school and football pitches, life is very different to how it was before. Ahmed doesn't let this affect his positivity though, and he finds new ways to have fun with his friends - even if it is in a desert sandstorm followed by flooding! As Ahmed cycles around the five mile square camp he introduces us to some of the other inspirational children who live there and we see the reality of life in a refugee camp from a child's unique point of view.(n)</desc>
