    <desc lang="en">Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a champ again. When there is a challenge from a Soviet giant named Drago (Dolph Lundgren), the challenger is laughed off. The Soviet government wants the prestige of a World Heavyweight Boxing Championship and stands fully behind Drago - a cold, blond, almost-bloodless fighting machine who is somewhat inhuman. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is now Rocky's manager and is appalled by the effrontery of the challenge. To teach the upstart a lesson in boxing, Apollo agrees to an exhibition match in Las Vegas.</desc>

This story is both a deeply personal and introspective portrait of a modern family, as well as a probing cinematic essay examining one of society's major ailments.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When Lily is upset to realise Matt is going out with cool girl Greta Masters, Jas plans a make-over slumber party to cheer her up. Unfortunately it clashes with a rare comet sighting, which Martha and Ollie are desperate to experience. They have even been allowed to borrow the very precious school telescope for the evening. Ollie is smuggled in to Lily's house by Martha to watch secretly from the attic, with Martha planning to split her time between both events. After much chaos and confusion, and with the presence of Ollie in the house rumbled, a compromise is finally reached, where the girls all get to do both the make-over and watch the rare comet. At the end of the make-over session Martha and Jas are horrified to see Lily has transformed herself to look exactly like Greta in a bid to impress Matt. To spare Lily's feelings they pretend to like her new look, but are relieved the next day in school to see Lily returned to her normal, natural self. Lily has realised it's better to be yourself, rather than try and change who you are just to please others.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Visiting Dr Ranj at the Children's hospital today is Petal. Petal needs the cast on her arm changing because it has got dirty and is crumbling. Petal has a fractured arm. Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit.</desc>
