    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

    <title lang="pl">Detektyw Cain</title>
    <sub-title lang="pl">Étoile filante</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">W operze w Marsylii dochodzi do dziwnego zdarzenia - w trakcie przedstawienia "Romeo i Julia" nagle umiera główny tancerz, Cyril Dubois. Istnieje kilku potencjalnych morderców. Jednym z nich jest Grigorij, który po śmierci Cyrila stanie na czele baletu. Podejrzenia padają również na zazdrosną Noémie, do szaleństwa zakochaną w denacie. Detektywi mają też wątpliwości co do innego baletmistrza, Serge Vassara - mógł on obawiać się konkurencji ze strony święcącego triumfy Cyrila. Prowadzący śledztwo Cain nie może być pewien nawet szczerości brata zmarłego, operowego osteopaty, który zna wszystkie mroczne tajemnice artystów. Tancerze swojej sztuce poświęcają ciało i duszę i mają przy tym świadomość, że nikt nie jest w stanie zagwarantować im sukcesu. Kierowani ambicją poddają się żelaznej dyscyplinie, żyją w zamkniętym świecie i wszystkie swoje siły koncentrują na karierze. Artyści są gotowi na wiele, dlatego nawet Cain nie może czuć się bezpiecznie w operze(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Hamburger Hill</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Trwa wojna w Wietnamie. Do wilgotnej, parnej dżungli przyjeżdżają nowe oddziały amerykańskich żołnierzy. Ci, którzy znajdują się tu do miesięcy, odliczają dni do końca swojej służby. Pozostali próbują przystosować się do panujących tu trudnych warunków. Wkrótce nadchodzi rozkaz zdobycia jednego ze wzgórz, oznaczonego na mapach numerem 937. Rozpoczyna się niezwykle krwawa walka. Przez dziesięć dni Amerykanie desperacko zmagają się z siłami Wietnamu Północnego. Kolejne próby zdobycia ufortyfikowanego, silnie bronionego wzgórza kończą się niepowodzeniem. Rozpaczliwą sytuację pogarsza jeszcze ulewny deszcz. Oparty na faktach brutalny i realistyczny film o wymowie antywojennej ukazuje jeden z najkrwawszych epizodów wojny w Wietnamie. Z powodu wielkiej liczby ofiar, których ciała zostały zmasakrowane przez ogień przeciwnika, miejsce, o które toczyły się walki, zyskało nazwę "Hamburger Hill"(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

    <sub-title lang="pl">Étoile filante</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">W operze w Marsylii dochodzi do dziwnego zdarzenia - w trakcie przedstawienia "Romeo i Julia" nagle umiera główny tancerz, Cyril Dubois. Istnieje kilku potencjalnych morderców. Jednym z nich jest Grigorij, który po śmierci Cyrila stanie na czele baletu. Podejrzenia padają również na zazdrosną Noémie, do szaleństwa zakochaną w denacie. Detektywi mają też wątpliwości co do innego baletmistrza, Serge Vassara - mógł on obawiać się konkurencji ze strony święcącego triumfy Cyrila. Prowadzący śledztwo Cain nie może być pewien nawet szczerości brata zmarłego, operowego osteopaty, który zna wszystkie mroczne tajemnice artystów. Tancerze swojej sztuce poświęcają ciało i duszę i mają przy tym świadomość, że nikt nie jest w stanie zagwarantować im sukcesu. Kierowani ambicją poddają się żelaznej dyscyplinie, żyją w zamkniętym świecie i wszystkie swoje siły koncentrują na karierze. Artyści są gotowi na wiele, dlatego nawet Cain nie może czuć się bezpiecznie w operze(n)</desc>

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości. Jej siostra Sarah (Lizzy Caplan) ma odmienne niż ona poglądy na życie. Kobieta w zupełnie inny sposób podchodzi do relacji z płcią przeciwną. Pragnie przede wszystkim niezależności i swobody, dlatego odrzuca nieoczekiwane oświadczyny swojego chłopaka, Kevina (Geoffrey Arend). Niedługo po rozstaniu w życiu Sarah pojawia się Jonathan (Mark Webber). Para wdaje się w namiętny romans, a uroczy mężczyzna szybko zdobywa jej serce. Niespodziewane uczucie zmusza ją do zastanowienia się nad swoimi wyborami i podjęcia trudnej decyzji(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">U 65-letniej Urszuli wykryto dwa tętniaki mózgu. Uciążliwy ból szyi nie zwiastował poważnej diagnozy. Wcześniej jeden z lekarzy zlecił wykonanie rezonansu magnetycznego kręgosłupa szyjnego, ale nie dostrzegł niczego niepokojącego. Zabiegi i leki nie przyniosły jednak poprawy. Ula zasięgnęła porady kolejnego specjalisty i dopiero ten zauważył na obrazie z rezonansu obecność dwóch tętniaków. Kilka lat wcześniej podobną diagnozę usłyszała jej córka Iza. Kobieta miała operację zabezpieczenia jednego tętniaka mózgu. Na szczęście wszystko dobrze się skończyło. Teraz Ula czeka na zabieg. Niestety, nie ma przy niej córki, która pracuje w Londynie. Ula gorąco wierzy, że operacja się powiedzie(n)</desc>

Śledczy spotykają się z Celine, tajemniczą wdową. Trafiają też do stoczni, gdzie pracował zmarły. Poznają tam Nathalie, młodą kobietę molestowaną przez Lecalma. W sprawę jest zamieszana również Joan Carbonnel, która zdiagnozowała u denata śmiertelną chorobę. Lekarka przewodniczy też "Adrenalinie", stowarzyszeniu sportów ekstremalnych, do którego należał pechowy motocykl. Cain i Lucie podejrzewają, że klub tak naprawdę powstał, by umożliwiać swoim członkom samobójstwo. Jednak Lecalm nie umarł z własnej winy. Według detektywa Celine, Nathalie i Joan stanowią klucz do rozwiązania tej zagadki(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

Pod nową postacią dwie osobowości kobiety muszą nauczyć się koegzystować. Deb, dla której przed wypadkiem świat koncentrował się wokół nieskazitelnego wyglądu, przechodzi równie spektakularną wewnętrzną metamorfozę. Jane i Belinda nie potrafią ze sobą współpracować, ale muszą razem zająć się sprawą gwiazdora rocka, który został wyrzucony z zespołu. Grayson walczy o ocalenie budynku mieszkalnego(n)</desc>

W ich programie zatytułowanym "Chyba sobie żarty robi" można zaleźć zarówno kultowego już "Organistę" oraz dobrze znanego widowni powolnego Pana Maczka, jak i całkiem nowe skecze i piosenki(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Hamburger Hill</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Trwa wojna w Wietnamie. Do wilgotnej, parnej dżungli przyjeżdżają nowe oddziały amerykańskich żołnierzy. Ci, którzy znajdują się tu do miesięcy, odliczają dni do końca swojej służby. Pozostali próbują przystosować się do panujących tu trudnych warunków. Wkrótce nadchodzi rozkaz zdobycia jednego ze wzgórz, oznaczonego na mapach numerem 937. Rozpoczyna się niezwykle krwawa walka. Przez dziesięć dni Amerykanie desperacko zmagają się z siłami Wietnamu Północnego. Kolejne próby zdobycia ufortyfikowanego, silnie bronionego wzgórza kończą się niepowodzeniem. Rozpaczliwą sytuację pogarsza jeszcze ulewny deszcz. Oparty na faktach brutalny i realistyczny film o wymowie antywojennej ukazuje jeden z najkrwawszych epizodów wojny w Wietnamie. Z powodu wielkiej liczby ofiar, których ciała zostały zmasakrowane przez ogień przeciwnika, miejsce, o które toczyły się walki, zyskało nazwę "Hamburger Hill"(n)</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The end of year exams are looming and Maud's annoyed that distracted Mildred isn't taking revision seriously. Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her(n)</desc>

Trixie and Olly dress up in clothes from that time and together they find out about a boy called Francis Drake, who became a famous sailor when he grew up. Trixie and Olly try out the types of food that sailors would have eaten, including some very hard ship's biscuits! Then, they discover why sailors had to be good at sewing. Together they visit a big ship just like the one Francis went on and find out all about the sorts of jobs a ship's boy had to do. Finally, they go looking for treasure!(n)</desc>
