    <desc lang="en">Three mini-episodes. In the first, a genie grants Peter three wishes and he ends up being propositioned by Catherine Zeta-Jones (voice of Alex Borstein). Then, exposure to toxic waste gives the Griffins super powers (one per Griffin). Finally, in flashbacks, L'il Peter braves a haunted house (for awhile) to impress L'il Lois. Alex Trebek has a voice cameo as himself, and Adam Corolla voices Death. (repeat) (cc)(n)</desc>

Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her</desc>

It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?</desc>
