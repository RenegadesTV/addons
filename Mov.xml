    <desc lang="pl">Vincent Libérati, najlepszy agent francuskiego kontrwywiadu, przebywa na misji w Afryce, kiedy dowiaduje się, że ma guza mózgu. Postanawia zakończyć pracę w tajnej służbie i ostatnie miesiące życia spędzić w Marsylii, niedaleko swojej córki Loli i byłej żony Aleksandry, która tymczasem układa sobie życie z miejscowym adwokatem. Nic im nie mówi o swojej chorobie, ale za to stara się spędzić jak najwięcej czasu z rodziną. Tymczasem otrzymuje pewną propozycję: weźmie udział w eksperymentalnej terapii w zamian za podjęcie się ściśle tajnej misji. Jego pierwszym zadaniem jest pochwycenie głównego handlarza narkotyków, który do tej pory był poza zasięgiem policji. Vincent musi tak działać, aby odnieść sukces, ale nie wzbudzić podejrzeń swojej siostry, policjantki Juliette. Skomplikowane śledztwo wymaga od niego dyskrecji, a zachowanie tajemnicy w towarzystwie siostry, córki i byłej żony staje się nie lada wyzwaniem(r)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Cal (Devon Graye) jest spokojnym nastolatkiem mieszkającym w niewielkim miasteczku. Pewnego dnia ten cichy chłopak postanawia jednak wstąpić do szkolnego koła zapaśników. Nastolatek bardzo chce iść w ślady swego ojca, który niegdyś był mistrzem stanu w tej dyscyplinie sportu. Po jego śmierci tradycję rodzinną kultywował starszy brat Cala, Mike (John Cena). Jednak jego kariera szybko legła w gruzach. Mimo to właśnie do niego nastolatek zgłasza się z prośbą o pomoc w treningach. Przydatne okazują się także rady sąsiada w dojrzałym wieku. Wyboru Cala nie akceptuje jednak jego matka, Sharon (Patricia Clarkson)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Prezentacja prawdziwych, najczęściej wykonywanych w Polsce, zabiegów chirurgicznych. Tu nie ma miejsca na scenariusz. Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Na ostry dyżur zgłasza się Jacek, emerytowany inżynier. Mężczyzna cierpi na krwotok z przewodu pokarmowego. Lekarze znajdują u niego guz jelita grubego i zalecają natychmiastową operację</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Cal (Devon Graye) jest spokojnym nastolatkiem mieszkającym w niewielkim miasteczku. Pewnego dnia ten cichy chłopak postanawia jednak wstąpić do szkolnego koła zapaśników. Nastolatek bardzo chce iść w ślady swego ojca, który niegdyś był mistrzem stanu w tej dyscyplinie sportu. Po jego śmierci tradycję rodzinną kultywował starszy brat Cala, Mike (John Cena). Jednak jego kariera szybko legła w gruzach. Mimo to właśnie do niego nastolatek zgłasza się z prośbą o pomoc w treningach. Przydatne okazują się także rady sąsiada w dojrzałym wieku. Wyboru Cala nie akceptuje jednak jego matka, Sharon (Patricia Clarkson)(n)</desc>
