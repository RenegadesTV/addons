    <title lang="en">The Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">A small band of friends make an uneasy alliance with a mysterious lone wolf in this blend of horror and adventure. An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group. Mary (Ashley Bell) is a solitary woman who crossed paths with the survivors and is now traveling with them. She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films</desc>

It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

Bald do-gooder guru G. (Eddie Murphy) assists when Ricky and marketing director Kate (Kelly Preston) get a freeway flat. When G. passes out, tests indicate a heart murmur and heat prostration, so the robed prophet becomes Ricky's house guest. At a party, G. uses hypnosis and psychology to rid guest Nino Cerruti (portraying himself) of his flying fears. Ricky witnesses this and gets the notion to put G. on the air. Unfortunately, G. ignores both cue cards and on-sale products, prompting station owner McBainbridge (Robert Loggia) to calculate Ricky's severance pay. He's back on the job when both sales and ratings soar. The situation eventually causes Ricky to reexamine how his own values became lost in the labyrinth of corporate consumerism(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Bruce Paltrow teams with his Oscar-winning daughter Gwyneth Paltrow for this road comedy with music. Paltrow plays Liv, a struggling professional singer whose meets her father, Ricky Dean (Huey Lewis), for the first time at the funeral of her mother. As it turns out, both Liv and Ricky supplement the income from few-and-far-between gigs by singing in karaoke contests, and soon father and daughter are competing on the same circuit. Meanwhile, Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti), a salesman who has grown disenchanted with his job, his family, and his life, picks up a hitch-hiker named Reggie Kane (Andre Braugher), and during a stop at a tavern, they discover they make a good duet team while belting out a version of "Try A Little Tenderness." And waitress Suzi Loomis (Maria Bello) sweet talks Billy (Scott Speedman), a cabbie, into driving her to Omaha, where the national karaoke finals will determine who does the best job of singing along with the records, as the lives of these six characters begin to intersect. Duets also features Angie Dickinson as Blair, Liv's grandmother who was once a showgirl in Frank Sinatra's Las Vegas floorshow; Brad Pitt was originally cast in Speedman's role but withdrew after he and Paltrow announced the end of their off-camera relationship(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mom and Pop Art. After seeing a commercial for a do-it-yourself Barbecue Pit Kit, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) tries building one himself, but the end result is a useless and unrecognizable mass of brick, mortal and metal. Homer has no luck returning it to the hardware store, but when the object is found by Astrid Weller (voice of Isabella Rossellini), proprietor of the "Louvre: American Style" art gallery, she presumes it's a sculpture by a gifted outsider artist, and puts it on display. When capricious multi-billionaire C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) buys the piece, Homer is officially a professional artist, and he quits his job to work up more sculptures for his first show. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), herself a talented artist, is a bit peeved that her husband has been proclaimed a genius by Springfield's intelligencia over a botched attempt at masonry, but Homer's one man show lands with a resounding thud, and Homer decides he needs to come up with a major project if the creative community is to continue to respect him. "Mom and Pop Art" first aired on April 11, 1999, and features a voice cameo from acclaimed artist Jasper Johns</desc>

When her mother remarries, Bella Swan moves to Washington State to live with her father Charlie. There, in the small, perpetually wintry town of Forks, she starts her new life, though she has no inkling of quite how different it's going to be. At her new school she quickly establishes herself as both a bit of a klutz and a hunk magnet. But she's not interested in most of the guys, apart from the moodily handsome, ashen complexioned Edward Cullen. And when he saves her from various threatening situations, their mutual attraction is sealed. There's just one problem he's a vampire. But although Edward and his undead family are 'vegetarians' who don't feed on humans, his breed find it very difficult to control their overwhelming desire for human blood when their emotions switch from love to lust..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Twilight Saga: New Moon</title>
    <desc lang="en">Catherine Hardwicke hands on the directorial baton to Chris Weitz for this second part of the cinematic adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's teen vampire saga. The chapter opens with Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) on the cusp of her 18th birthday and blissfully happy with her undead beau Edward Cullen. But, while she's celebrating her birthday with Edward's family of 'vegetarian' vampires, a frightening incident convinces Edward that he's simply too dangerous to be around his sweetheart. He leaves the town of Forks in order to ensure her safety - leaving her behind, angry and depressed. Bella finds some relief from her emotional numbness through recklessly riding motorbikes and succumbing to the attentions of her friend Jacob Black. But he is also a supernatural being, and not one with a natural affinity to vampires..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Barbershop</title>
    <desc lang="en">Calvin (Ice Cube) never wanted to take over the family business, a barbershop on the south side of Chicago. Disgusted with the shop's crime-ridden neighborhood, and caught up in his moneymaking schemes, one morning Calvin decides to sell the shop to the shady Lester (Keith David). Chastised by his pregnant wife, Jennifer (Jazsmin Lewis), for his rash decision, Calvin spends the day cutting heads at the shop, and starts to understand the importance of the legacy his grandfather and father have left to him. The bickering barbers include Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), the old-timer with his own unique perspective on black life; Terri (rapper Eve in her film debut), a hot-tempered woman with a trifling boyfriend; Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), a college educated snob; Ricky (Michael Ealy) a reformed criminal; Isaac (Troy Garity, the son of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden), a white B-Boy, whom no one is ready to let cut their hair; and Dinka (Leonard Howze), a recent African immigrant who's too shy to express his feelings for Terri. Calvin learns to appreciate them all, and discovers that the place where they work is more than just a place to get a haircut -- it's a meeting place for the neighborhood, a place where folks can speak their minds and find out what's happening. Calvin gradually changes his mind about selling the shop, but it may be too late. Meanwhile, a bumbling thief, J.D. (Anthony Anderson) spends a painful day trying to crack open the ATM he's stolen from the grocery store across the street. Barbershop was directed by Tim Story and produced by George Tillman Jr. and Robert Teitel, the producers of Soul Food. Barbershop had its world premiere at the 2002 Urbanworld Film Festival</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The sole survivor of a Viking "dragon" vessel shipwrecked on the eastern shores of the New World 15 years ago provides the only hope for the a Native American tribe faced with certain destruction by Norse berserkers in director Marcus Nispel's (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) dark action adventure. Reared by the Wampanoag tribe following a failed attempt by the Vikings to raid coastal villages for slaves, a ten-year-old shipwreck survivor is nicknamed "Ghost" by his adoptive tribe due to his pale complexion and blond hair. Legend says that death and destruction will follow the boy wherever he travels, yet the peaceful people of the Wampanoag tribe selflessly take the frightened child in as if he is one of their own. Over the course of the following decade, the adopted young Norseman eventually grows into a strong warrior (Karl Urban) determined to prove his worth to the people he calls family. When the rampaging Vikings return to the New World to rain destruction down on the Native Americans and to claim the fertile land of the peaceful people, Ghost finds himself in the precarious position of having to stop his own people from destroying his village and ruthlessly slaughtering the woman he loves (Moon Bloodgood). Now, as Ghost's true destiny is revealed by the powerful shaman known as the Pathfinder (Russell Means), the fearless warrior sets out to stage a savage one-man war on the marauding Vikings and become the savior once prophesied to defend the Wampanoag people in their darkest hour</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Blue</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop's personal code of justice begins to change after a number of incidents lead his city to a tragic wave of violence in this police drama. Eldon Perry (Kurt Russell) is a veteran cop with the LAPD's Special Investigations unit, a man who isn't above bending the law if it means putting people behind bars who deserve the treatment. As Los Angeles waits on the verdict in the Rodney King police beating trial, Perry is presenting testimony to Assistant Chief of Police Arthur Holland (Ving Rhames), who is well aware of the corruption in the SIS unit and wants to stop it. Perry, however, twists some facts as he speaks in the defense of his new partner, Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman), who is being investigated for inappropriate use of deadly force. For lack of honest testimony, Keough is let off the hook, and soon he and Perry have a new case to investigate -- a robbery at a liquor store than turned into a quadruple homicide. Perry and Keough quickly track down two likely suspects, Orchard (Kurupt) and Sidwell (Dash Mihok), but Perry is surprised when the head of SIS, Van Meter (Brendan Gleeson), tells him to let Orchard and Sidwell go, and instead points the finger at two ex-cons who should be taken off the street, even though they're innocent of this crime. Perry follows Van Meter's orders, despite Keough's misgivings, but in the wake of the L.A. riots, Perry has a change of heart, and decides to start working with Holland against Van Meter's corrupt methods. In the midst of it all, Perry is trying to hold together his troubled marriage to Sally (Lolita Davidovich), while Keough finds himself romancing a fellow officer, Beth (Michael Michele). Dark Blue was adapted from an original screenplay by noted crime novelist James Ellroy; originally set against the backdrop of the 1965 Watts riots, the story was later updated to 1992(n)</desc>

Iona and grandad James dress up in clothes from the time known as the Highland Clearances. They learn about a boy called Lachlan and why he, and many other families, had to leave their homes and move to a new country. Together they discover what life was like for Lachlan in Scotland - where he would live, the language he spoke, the food he would have eaten and the jobs he would do to help his family. Iona and grandad James then visit an American township to see how different Lachlan's new life in America would have been and they try their hand at panning for gold.(n)</desc>
