W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej.

Podczas śledztwa spotyka państwa Mouchet - starszą parę, które może kryć mroczne tajemnice; Forestiera - pewnego siebie prawnika; oraz Antoine'a Virandellesa - zadbanego marsylczyka. Cain będzie zmuszony skorzystać metod, których wcześniej unikał. W tym celu poszuka wspólnego języka z dziennikarką Sonią i wyciągnie z więzienia gangstera Stefano, który w przeszłości był dla detektywa jak drugi ojciec. Sukces śledztwa zależy jednak od tego, czy Lucie nawiąże kontakt z Antoinem Virandellesem(n)</desc>

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej.

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową.

Iona and grandad James dress up in clothes from the time known as the Highland Clearances. They learn about a boy called Lachlan and why he, and many other families, had to leave their homes and move to a new country. Together they discover what life was like for Lachlan in Scotland - where he would live, the language he spoke, the food he would have eaten and the jobs he would do to help his family. Iona and grandad James then visit an American township to see how different Lachlan's new life in America would have been and they try their hand at panning for gold(n)</desc>
