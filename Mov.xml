    <desc lang="en">In 1969, there's trouble brewing on the Paris set of the cartoon sexpionage saga "Dragonfly." After firing the film's arty auteur (Gerard Depardieu), its Italian producer (Giancarlo Giannini) gives the reins to a young American filmmaker (Jeremy Davis) who has been shooting his own film diary while abroad. Now he is faced with coming up with a new ending for "Dragonfly," while coping with the distractions of his sultry leading lady (Angela Lindvall). In his feature debut, Roman Coppola recreates a loving tribute to the world of late '60s pop.(n)</desc>

Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Alone in Berlin</title>
    <desc lang="en">Otto and Anna Quangel (Brendan Gleeson &amp; Emma Thompson) are a working-class husband and wife doing their best to ride out the war in Berlin in 1940. When their son is killed fighting on the frontlines however, everything changes. They begin pouring their rage and grief into postcards emblazoned with anti-Nazi slogans, risking everything to get their messages of protest across the city. This seemingly small act of subversion rattles the regime, including a police inspector (Daniel Brühl) who will not rest until the culprits have been caught.(n)</desc>

All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben.(n)</desc>
