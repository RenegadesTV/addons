    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

Connecting them all via remote wifi from Thailand is vlogger extraordinaire Saara. This is the show that answers all the important questions like how many years does the average person spend on the toilet and is being humiliated by your parents' singing worth it if you win Samojis? Harry loves Saara's Finnish Gravy so much he sprays it over his dad in Food Flash and there's some dodgy rule-bending in Remotely Funny Families but only one person can walk away with the hottest of hot prizes- the legendary Remotely Funny hoodies.(n)</desc>
