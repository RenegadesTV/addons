    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery.

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery.

Today our pesky pranksters Koala Bunnies (Svetlana and Neptune) and Prank Bosses (James and Caiden) join forces with prosthetics and make-up wiz CJ Goldman and SFX guru Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. Teams summon wizards and aliens on a busy city street corner and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life! But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? Get ready for some gut-busting reactions when Svetlana and Neptune's 'Blizzard-ade' faces off with James and Caiden's 'Alien Crash Landing'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. And for the winning team, CJ and Andy have planned the ultimate mega prank with the wackiest obstacle course challenge ever created! Exploding cakes, spraying cream and a crazed clown aren't the only obstacles to avoid on this course. If the 'target' is going to make it through, he'll have to dodge a grizzly bear too! It's one huge bear and one hilarious MEGA PRANK!(n)</desc>

In Jordan, eight-year-old Hamza makes lunch with his mum. In Vietnam, Truc, who is seven, makes paper butterflies at school and wins a relay race. And in Italy, seven-year-old Mario and his brother and sister spend the day at their grandma's house, dressing up and eating ice cream. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal(n)</desc>
