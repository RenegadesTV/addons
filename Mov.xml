    <desc lang="en">For most of us, the notion of living on the streets is little more than food for thought. But for a homeless father (Jeff Bridges) and his teenage son (Edward Furlong), it's a cold, hard fact of life. Director Martin Bell first explored life in the not-so-great outdoors with his 1984 documentary "Streetwise," an unforgettable look at the day-to-day tragedy of Seattle's street teens. With this eye-opening drama, he looks at this avoidable human catastrophe from a somewhat different perspective. Featuring music by Tom Waits(n)</desc>

W tym samym czasie córki gospodarzy razem z Frankiem starają się pomóc Tomowi w ucieczce ze szpitala. Aby tego dokonać, wspólnie układają niezwykle śmiały plan. Ich zdaniem młody żołnierz musi dołączyć do wojsk konfederatów, niestety on sam nie ma sił do dalszej walki. Aurelia popełnia duży błąd, próbując przeprowadzić aborcję na sobie samej. Mary przerywa "kwarantannę" doktora Fostera, który wciąż nie może dojść do siebie po nagłej detoksykacji. Doświadczony lekarz musi pokierować Samuelem podczas zabiegu wymagającego dużej delikatności i precyzji. Od ich powodzenia zależy życie Aurelii</desc>

Prawniczka odkrywa, że pracowała już u niego bezpośrednio po szkole prawniczej i najwyraźniej łączyło ich coś więcej niż tylko relacje służbowe. Oczywiście Jane nie ma pojęcia, co wydarzyło się między nimi przed ośmiu laty. Prawniczka zajmie się sprawą, którą wtedy prowadziła - morderstwa osiemnastoletniej Eleny Estrady. Upewnia się, że do zbrodni musiało dojść, gdy dziewczyna była w drodze ze swojego domu w Malibu do rezydencji przyjaciela Nate Persky'ego. Jednak ojciec chłopaka dał mu wtedy alibi i podtrzymuje je. A ponieważ Warren Persky to jeden z najbardziej wpływowych ludzi w Los Angeles, prokurator nie śmiał wątpić w jego słowo. Jane przeżywa szok, gdy ustala, że Alan Robert osobiście interweniował przed laty, aby ówczesny chłopak ofiary nie trafił do kręgu podejrzanych. Tymczasem Stacy popada w tarapaty, z których próbuje ją wybawić Grayston(n)</desc>

Wszystko układało się po ich myśli, ale do czasu... Mateusz, chcąc uzyskać zwolnienie lekarskie, postanowił symulować chorobę. Zadzwonił po karetkę, twierdząc, że chwilę wcześniej stracił przytomność. W szpitalu zrobiono mu podstawowe badania. Gdy miał zostać wypisany, zlecono kolejne. Okazało się, że jedna z zastawek sercowych nie pracuje prawidłowo. Lekarze zlecili natychmiastową operację. W jednym momencie życie Mateusza legło w gruzach.

Sztab specjalistów - od wizażystki, przez stylistę, po fryzjera i psychologa - zadba o to, by w szafie uczestniczki już nigdy nie pojawiły się niemodne, kiczowate ubrania, które szpecą swoją właścicielkę. Z pomocą doradców modna pani zapozna się z najnowszymi trendami i dobierze nie tylko odpowiednią garderobę, lecz także kolor włosów, fryzurę i makijaż. Stare ubrania zostaną spalone - naprawdę! A na odmienioną uczestniczkę czekać będzie sesja zdjęciowa z profesjonalnym fotografem i grono przyjaciół, którzy ocenią metamorfozę(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Jane pracuje chwilowo w biurze prokuratury. Przez najbliższe dwa tygodnie jej szefem będzie prokurator Alan Robert. Prawniczka odkrywa, że pracowała już u niego bezpośrednio po szkole prawniczej i najwyraźniej łączyło ich coś więcej niż tylko relacje służbowe. Oczywiście Jane nie ma pojęcia, co wydarzyło się między nimi przed ośmiu laty. Prawniczka zajmie się sprawą, którą wtedy prowadziła - morderstwa osiemnastoletniej Eleny Estrady. Upewnia się, że do zbrodni musiało dojść, gdy dziewczyna była w drodze ze swojego domu w Malibu do rezydencji przyjaciela Nate Persky'ego. Jednak ojciec chłopaka dał mu wtedy alibi i podtrzymuje je. A ponieważ Warren Persky to jeden z najbardziej wpływowych ludzi w Los Angeles, prokurator nie śmiał wątpić w jego słowo. Jane przeżywa szok, gdy ustala, że Alan Robert osobiście interweniował przed laty, aby ówczesny chłopak ofiary nie trafił do kręgu podejrzanych. Tymczasem Stacy popada w tarapaty, z których próbuje ją wybawić Grayston(n)</desc>

So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!.</desc>
