Hockey legends Mark Messier and Doug Gilmour headline a rowdy sports comedy featuring Leslie Nielsen. The championship game is coming up. Perhaps if the Hanson brothers can teach their young protégés the true value of a solid check, these inexperienced underdogs can use brutality to their advantage and finally score a winning goal.

Today teams invade an office building and for unsuspecting targets, it's going to be anything but another... day at the office! It's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's a battle between the head-scratching 'Office Switcheroo' and the super-charged 'Trainwreck Hallway'! Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, Marc, Andy and Devon have planned a MEGA PRANK packed with ninja power! The setting is a martial arts dojo, complete with flying rigs, flying crates and flying people! Will the targets flap their wings and take flight too? One thing's for sure, this MEGA PRANK is gonna be fly!</desc>
