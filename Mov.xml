With a party to organise the gang get to work - Matilda's brother Jack and sisters Megan and Holly take shopping to another level as they speed along the river Thames on a high-performance rib to pick up supplies. Matilda's in charge of the party food: build your own spicy sausage pitta bread sandwiches with zingy yoghurt sauce and popcorn cakes. The popcorn cakes idea came from Scarlet, a Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch viewer who emailed it to Matilda's Food Blog. Great food, friends and fun, and the party finishing with a bang when the guys play an explosive game with a watermelon - parties don't get much better!</desc>
