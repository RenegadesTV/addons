    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school</desc>

    <title lang="en">Harry Potter: A History of Magic</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary exploring the myths, traditions and everyday artefacts that inspired JK Rowling as she crafted the wizarding world depicted in her celebrated Harry Potter series. The British Library is marking the 20th anniversary of the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with an exhibition showcasing unseen manuscripts, drawings, drafts and personal items from Rowling's private archives, and this programme sheds light on how the objects on display helped to fire the author's imagination over the course of the past two decades. Famous fans offer playful readings that recreate some of the best-loved spells, potion recipes and magical moments from the books, and the programme introduces individuals who have made the magic of the novels a reality, from real-life wand-makers to passionate Quidditch enthusiasts. Narrated by Imelda Staunton</desc>
