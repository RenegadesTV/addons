Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek.

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her</desc>

A trip to the zoo is next to observe how animals move and to observe their expressions. Writer Michael Rosen pops up to give some advice on their work before setting them the task of making their own illustrated books - the end result is amazing(n)</desc>

Unfortunately it clashes with a rare comet sighting, which Martha and Ollie are desperate to experience. They have even been allowed to borrow the very precious school telescope for the evening. Ollie is smuggled in to Lily's house by Martha to watch secretly from the attic, with Martha planning to split her time between both events. After much chaos and confusion, and with the presence of Ollie in the house rumbled, a compromise is finally reached, where the girls all get to do both the make-over and watch the rare comet. At the end of the make-over session Martha and Jas are horrified to see Lily has transformed herself to look exactly like Greta in a bid to impress Matt. To spare Lily's feelings they pretend to like her new look, but are relieved the next day in school to see Lily returned to her normal, natural self. Lily has realised it's better to be yourself, rather than try and change who you are just to please others(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Melody and her mum arrive at The Purcell School, to see her friend Joe, who plays the Marimba. Mum and Melody arrive in the corridor where they can hear the Marimba. They find Joe who shows Melody different mallets and demonstrates the sounds they makes and lets Melody have a go. Melody and her mum then hurry to meet Melody's friends who are also going to watch Joe give a recital of Two Movements composed by Toshimitsu Tanaka. Melody is looking forward to knowing what the music will make her friends think of. The music begins, and Melody's imagination, with the help of animation gets to work. Mum and Melody then go and meet the friends. The music is played again and with animation we see what the music makes the friends think of(n)</desc>
