    <title lang="en">Mr Stink</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Twelve-year-old Chloe leads a lonely existence - her mother is too busy with her political ambitions to take any interest in her daughter, her hen-pecked dad is hiding a secret of his own and she cannot hope to compete with her `perfect' younger sister - to say nothing of the nasty girls who make her school life a misery. So when she meets a tramp in need of somewhere to stay, she invites him to hide in her family's garden shed - but it soon turns out there is more to her smelly guest than meets the eye. Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville stars, with Sheridan Smith, Johnny Vegas and Isabella Blake-Thomas, and an appearance from Britain's Got Talent winner Pudsey the dog.(n)</desc>
