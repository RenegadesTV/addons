Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka</desc>

When the truth comes out about why his dad really left, Jamie lashes out, threatening to ruin everything all over again. But a selfless act on the pitch shows Hansard what Jamie's really made of; and out of it, comes a prize beyond Jamie's wildest dreams.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Worst Witch</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Pond Life.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Mildred's having fun jumping high into the air with Enid - using pirated magic to make the grass bouncy. Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.(n)</desc>

Elmo asks why they are all shouting 'Furball' and Furgus says that it's because the Furball has arrived, it's the best game ever, whenever he turns up at the hotel they all play a game of 'Furball', he's very excited and goes to get his Furball equipment bag and everything is there except his Furball shoes. Furgus and Funella go to look for his shoes and tell Phoebe and Elmo to keep an eye on the Furball and not let him out of their sight. Just at that moment, the Furball disappears, only for them to spot him up on the balcony, they're soon chasing him all over the hotel. Phoebe decides to look in her Dad's Furball bag and finds a Furball net, they hear boinging and get ready to pounce, but they catch a very suspicious looking rabbit instead. Cookie Monster then comes along and tells them to use Furball bait - a cookie! They put the cookie in the Furball net and wait, but instead of catching a Furball they catch Cookie Monster instead, with which he remembers that cookies are Cookie Monster bait, not Furball bait.</desc>
