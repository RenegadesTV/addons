Five ambitious American college students are issued a grant to return to the site of the original events in the belief that they can uncover and document the truth of what happened. Their trek through the mountains, retracing the steps of that ill-fated journey, is plagued by strange and increasingly terrifying phenomena, all of which suggest that they are not alone. The forces behind the Dyatlov Pass Incident are waiting for them.(n)</desc>

Expert rock movers Bevel, Zip and Pop arrive, but they can't move it either. Looking for things to help them, Bitz finds some logs to roll the rock, but Bevel stops to eat a banana and the rock rolls off out of control, causing the logs to go everywhere. But maybe floating the rock would work.(n)</desc>
