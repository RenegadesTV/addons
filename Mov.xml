    <desc lang="en">This highly acclaimed, Oscar® winning independent drama marked the extraordinary sophomore effort of writer and director Sofia Coppola, who crafts a resonant, understated drama about a movie star (Bill Murray) visiting Tokyo to appear in a liquor commercial, who befriends the lonely, hotel-bound wife (Scarlett Johansson) of a celebrity photographer. Together, the two lost, culturally adrift, insomniac Americans become platonic soul mates, exploring the city and discovering a kindred spirit to combat their shared isolation.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boxer Vinny Pazienza (Miles Teller) moves up two weight classes under the guidance of his new trainer Kevin Rooney (Aaron Eckhart). Pazienza takes down French boxer Gilbert Delé to become Super Middleweight Champion. Shortly after the bout however, a head-on car crash leaves him with a broken neck. Initially told he may never walk again, Pazienza chooses a risky "halo" spine-stabilization treatment, requiring him to wear a circular metal brace screwed directly into his skull for six months.</desc>
