In this programme we drop in on three seven-year-olds who are all having a very busy day. In Vietnam, Truc takes pity on her lonely goldfish and goes shopping for some companions. In Russia, Liza and her twin brother, Styopa, take part in a craft class and make a lucky horseshoe for someone special. And in Jordan, Hamza makes a pizza for a picnic with his family in the local park - and scores a goal against his dad. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we drop in on three seven-year-olds who are all having a very busy day. In Vietnam, Truc takes pity on her lonely goldfish and goes shopping for some companions. In Russia, Liza and her twin brother, Styopa, take part in a craft class and make a lucky horseshoe for someone special. And in Jordan, Hamza makes a pizza for a picnic with his family in the local park - and scores a goal against his dad. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal(n)</desc>
