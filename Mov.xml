Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. 57-letnia Aldona czeka na operację guza piersi. O nowotworze dowiedziała się dzięki badaniom profilaktycznym. Wykrycie choroby we wczesnym stadium daje jej spore szanse na powrót do pełni sił(n)</desc>

Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę(n)</desc>
