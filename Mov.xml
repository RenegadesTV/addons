When he transfers to a new school, Rafe and his scheming best friend Leo hatch a plan to break every rule in the school's code of conduct. This causes a battle with the principal, which explodes into chaos both real and imagined. Rafe struggles to hide his misbehavior from Jeanne, the straight-A, overachieving girl of his dreams, while at home, his mother's boyfriend - a moochy, jack-of-no-trades named Bear - threatens to become his stepfather.(n)</desc>

In Russia, seven-year-old Liza picks blueberries with her grandma - and helps turn them into delicious pancakes. In Ghana, Tyra, who's five, goes to the market with her mum and learns how to do the shopping. And in Jordan, Hamza, who's eight, has a day out in town with his dad, and buys a lovely present for his baby sister, Mimi. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.</desc>
