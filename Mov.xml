With this eye-opening drama, he looks at this avoidable human catastrophe from a somewhat different perspective. Featuring music by Tom Waits</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

    <desc lang="pl">W operze w Marsylii dochodzi do dziwnego zdarzenia - w trakcie przedstawienia "Romeo i Julia" nagle umiera główny tancerz, Cyril Dubois. Istnieje kilku potencjalnych morderców. Jednym z nich jest Grigorij, który po śmierci Cyrila stanie na czele baletu. Podejrzenia padają również na zazdrosną Noémie, do szaleństwa zakochaną w denacie. Detektywi mają też wątpliwości co do innego baletmistrza, Serge Vassara - mógł on obawiać się konkurencji ze strony święcącego triumfy Cyrila. Prowadzący śledztwo Cain nie może być pewien nawet szczerości brata zmarłego, operowego osteopaty, który zna wszystkie mroczne tajemnice artystów. Tancerze swojej sztuce poświęcają ciało i duszę i mają przy tym świadomość, że nikt nie jest w stanie zagwarantować im sukcesu. Kierowani ambicją poddają się żelaznej dyscyplinie, żyją w zamkniętym świecie i wszystkie swoje siły koncentrują na karierze. Artyści są gotowi na wiele, dlatego nawet Cain nie może czuć się bezpiecznie w operze(n)</desc>

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości.

    <desc lang="pl">40-letni ksiądz Marcin to klasyczny przypadek osoby uzależnionej od jedzenia. Wiele razy podejmował próbę walki z otyłością. Niestety, obżarstwo zawsze wygrywało ze zdrowym rozsądkiem. Pierwszą operację zmniejszenia żołądka przeszedł parę lat temu. Zrzucił wtedy kilkadziesiąt kilogramów. Odzyskał kondycję i sprawność fizyczną. Szansę jednak na normalne życie stracił na własne życzenie. Powoli przyzwyczajał żołądek do chorobliwego objadania się, co doprowadziło do jeszcze większej nadwagi. Marcin zdecydował się na kolejną operację. Za jakiś czas również wrócił do nałogu jedzenia. Podjął trzecia próbę. Kamera towarzyszy Marcinowi i lekarzom podczas przygotowań i samej operacji zmniejszenia żołądka(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kobieta za kierownicą stała się bohaterką wielu dowcipów, a w brzydkiej części użytkowników dróg w najlepszym wypadku budzi uśmiech politowania. W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Étoile filante</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">W operze w Marsylii dochodzi do dziwnego zdarzenia - w trakcie przedstawienia "Romeo i Julia" nagle umiera główny tancerz, Cyril Dubois. Istnieje kilku potencjalnych morderców. Jednym z nich jest Grigorij, który po śmierci Cyrila stanie na czele baletu. Podejrzenia padają również na zazdrosną Noémie, do szaleństwa zakochaną w denacie. Detektywi mają też wątpliwości co do innego baletmistrza, Serge Vassara - mógł on obawiać się konkurencji ze strony święcącego triumfy Cyrila. Prowadzący śledztwo Cain nie może być pewien nawet szczerości brata zmarłego, operowego osteopaty, który zna wszystkie mroczne tajemnice artystów. Tancerze swojej sztuce poświęcają ciało i duszę i mają przy tym świadomość, że nikt nie jest w stanie zagwarantować im sukcesu. Kierowani ambicją poddają się żelaznej dyscyplinie, żyją w zamkniętym świecie i wszystkie swoje siły koncentrują na karierze. Artyści są gotowi na wiele, dlatego nawet Cain nie może czuć się bezpiecznie w operze(n)</desc>

Beth (Alison Brie) i jej długoletni partner Andrew (Martin Starr) mają wkrótce stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu. Przyszła panna młoda czyni gorączkowe przygotowania do uroczystości. Jej siostra Sarah (Lizzy Caplan) ma odmienne niż ona poglądy na życie. Kobieta w zupełnie inny sposób podchodzi do relacji z płcią przeciwną. Pragnie przede wszystkim niezależności i swobody, dlatego odrzuca nieoczekiwane oświadczyny swojego chłopaka, Kevina (Geoffrey Arend). Niedługo po rozstaniu w życiu Sarah pojawia się Jonathan (Mark Webber). Para wdaje się w namiętny romans, a uroczy mężczyzna szybko zdobywa jej serce. Niespodziewane uczucie zmusza ją do zastanowienia się nad swoimi wyborami i podjęcia trudnej decyzji(n)</desc>

Swashbuckle's Cook and Line (Joseph Elliott and Richard David-Caine) swap swabbing the deck for treading the boards as a pair of stage-hands helping William Shakespeare put on his play. Josette Simon and Roger Griffiths preside as Titania and Oberon, Queen and King of the Fairies, while Mr Tumble star Justin Fletcher clowns around as Bottom the Weaver, the star of the play-within-a-play</desc>

Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line</desc>

Trixie and Olly dress up in clothes from that time and together they find out about a boy called Francis Drake, who became a famous sailor when he grew up. Trixie and Olly try out the types of food that sailors would have eaten, including some very hard ship's biscuits! Then, they discover why sailors had to be good at sewing. Together they visit a big ship just like the one Francis went on and find out all about the sorts of jobs a ship's boy had to do. Finally, they go looking for treasure!(n)</desc>
