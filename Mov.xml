    <desc lang="en">Coroner Tommy Tilden and son Austin run a morgue and crematorium in Virginia. When the local sheriff brings in a body found in the basement of a home, it seems like just another open-and-shut case.

    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">68 Kill</title>
    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The presenter cruises around Cuba aboard the Celestyal Crystal, starting and ending in Havana, sampling the relatively new tourist industry of the Caribbean island. A stop in Cienfuegos leads to a salsa lesson and a flying visit to Jamaica allows Jane to have lunch in, or rather on, a floating Rasta Raft just off the beach in Runaway Bay. Before heading back to Havana, there's just time to join in the fun of a house party in Santiago de Cuba. And as the singer soon discovers, no one parties quite like the Cubans.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this programme we visit three children who are all having a fascinating day out. In Russia, seven-year-old Liza picks blueberries with her grandma - and helps turn them into delicious pancakes. In Ghana, Tyra, who's five, goes to the market with her mum and learns how to do the shopping. And in Jordan, Hamza, who's eight, has a day out in town with his dad, and buys a lovely present for his baby sister, Mimi. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Maddie is out and about exploring different ways to travel. She uses a special camera to find out how a bus ramp works to help people get on and off the bus. An animation shows how the ramp is hidden in a compartment underneath the doors and how air bags allow the bus to lower on one side. Next, Maddie joins a road-building team to see how a motorway is made of different layers and uses a special thermal imaging camera to see how the hot asphalt is laid.(n)</desc>
