    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Stolica Anglii to tętniąca życiem metropolia. Zatłoczone chodniki i korki na ulicach to codzienność Londynu. Mieszkanie w wielkim mieście może być męczące, dlatego Rachel od czasu do czasu pozwala sobie na chwilę wytchnienia. Dziś wybiera się na przejażdżkę rowerową i odwiedza miejski ogródek znajomego. Po powrocie do domu przyrządza kolację, na którą składa się sałatka, ciasto oraz danie wegetariańskie</desc>

Mężczyzna podróżuje po świecie i zwiedza niezwykłe miejsca. Niestety objawy, które towarzyszą jego chorobie - częste oddawanie moczu - stanowią poważną przeszkodę również w codziennym życiu. Grzegorz cierpi na prostatę od dwudziestu lat, wreszcie podjął decyzję i poddał się zabiegowi laserowego usunięcia przerostu gruczołu krokowego. Operację tę wykonuje się w znieczuleniu miejscowym, trwa ona około godziny. Pacjent powinien odczuć poprawę już w pierwszych tygodniach po zabiegu. Ekipa programu będzie towarzyszyć Grzegorzowi na każdym etapie leczenia, pozna również jego finalny efekt</desc>

Niespodziewana śmierć dziecka burzy ich poukładane życie. Pogrążeni w rozpaczy małżonkowie chcą godnie uczcić pamięć zmarłej dziewczynki i jednocześnie pomóc lokalnej społeczności. Po namyśle postanawiają zbudować szpital oferujący specjalistyczne leczenie najmłodszym pacjentom. Placówka miałaby także zapewniać opiekę rodzinom osób, które przegrały walkę z chorobą. W realizacji ambitnych planów mogą liczyć na wsparcie oddanego przyjaciela, Bruce'a (Timothy Hutton). Kiedy udaje się im przekonać urzędników i władze do swojego pomysłu, czeka ich żmudna praca nad niecodziennym projektem. Dzięki temu oboje zyskują szansę na odbudowanie swoich relacji i uporanie się z żałobą. Scenariusz produkcji opiera się na prawdziwych wydarzeniach.

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia.

Następnie we wschodnim Londynie Rachel pod okiem miejscowego szefa kuchni zgłębia tajniki egzotycznych dań, by później już we własnej kuchni przygotować orientalnego kurczaka z malezyjską sałatką i bułeczkami na parze(n)</desc>

Dostała się na studia dziennikarstwa, dostała również stypendium. Nie odnalazła się jednak zupełnie w środowisku studenckim, nie miała koleżanek, czuła się samotna w związku z czym porzuciła studia. Helena ma trudności ze znalezieniem dla siebie miejsca i zajęcia. Jak sama mówi, to przez to, że się nie uśmiecha. Uważa też, że koleżanki z pracy zazdroszczą jej tego, że jest atrakcyjna. Dziewczyna czuje, że nigdzie nie pasuje, a wszyscy ją odtrącają(n)</desc>

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej.

    <desc lang="pl">Cekiny, róże i tygrysie cętki - o tym i wielu innych przykładach złego gustu na zawsze zapomni każda z uczestniczek tego programu. Sztab specjalistów - od wizażystki, przez stylistę, po fryzjera i psychologa - zadba o to, by w szafie uczestniczki już nigdy nie pojawiły się niemodne, kiczowate ubrania, które szpecą swoją właścicielkę. Z pomocą doradców modna pani zapozna się z najnowszymi trendami i dobierze nie tylko odpowiednią garderobę, lecz także kolor włosów, fryzurę i makijaż. Stare ubrania zostaną spalone - naprawdę! A na odmienioną uczestniczkę czekać będzie sesja zdjęciowa z profesjonalnym fotografem i grono przyjaciół, którzy ocenią metamorfozę(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Jane coraz bardziej angażuje się w związek z sędzią Frenchem. Po powrocie z Włoch prawniczka dowiaduje się od Teri, że kancelaria jej potrzebuje. Tymczasem Grayson pragnie z nią szczerze porozmawiać, gdyż zaczyna domyślać się, kim Jane jest naprawdę. Zmienia jednak zdanie, gdy widzi ją szczęśliwą z Owenem. Tymczasem Stacy - po tym jak rozpadł się jej związek z Fredem - jest tak zdesperowana, że zgłasza się po poradę do uznanej terapeutki par, Nikki LePree. Jednak Jane niespodziewanie otrzymuje nowego anioła stróża - Luke'a, który oficjalnie przybywa, by zająć się finansami "Harrison &amp; Parker", którymi tymczasowo zarządzała Kim - ambitna prawniczka, ale kiepska menadżerka. Po powrocie z Chicago Jay Parker przejmuje stery w firmie, ale uprzedza, że jego priorytety zmieniły się i teraz bardziej zależy mu na odzyskaniu syna niż karierze prawniczej. Jane wraca do kancelarii, by reprezentować przed sądem swoją szkolną koleżankę Emily Horn, która została oskarżona o morderstwo z premedytacją(n)</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>
