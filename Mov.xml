On February 4th, 2017, Black Sabbath takes the stage in Birmingham, the city where it all began, to play the 81st and final gig of the tour and bring down the curtain on a career that spanned almost half a century. The cameras are taken into the heart of the action, getting up close and personal with the band as they perform genre-defining hits, from 'Iron Man' to 'Paranoid' to 'War Pigs', among others. The special also features a studio performance of some of their songs not played on the tour</desc>
