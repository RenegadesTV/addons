Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego</desc>

Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gretchen i doktor Kaan zbliżają się do siebie. Mimo to kobieta nie potrafi powstrzymać się przed nieustannym porównywaniem się z jego byłą ukochaną. Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Eye Contact 101.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Mrs Griggs decides that a 'social skills' class could be beneficial for certain pupils - including Martha, Rufus, Cassie and Maxwell. When Mrs Griggs tells Martha a winning personality as well as academic achievement is vital in order to get into a top university, Martha panics and is determined to succeed in the social skills class and prove she does indeed have a winning personality. Mrs Griggs volunteers a reluctant Mr Malone to take the classes and hands him a book written by her beloved 'Guru Holeman' called Being Whole as a manual to help him. When Lily is mistakenly led to believe by Jas that Matt is emigrating to Australia she is distraught that he hasn't even told her he's leaving. She becomes convinced it's because she's too easy-going that he hasn't even bothered to tell her. She begs Mrs Griggs to let her go to social skills class, too, so she can learn to be less easy-going. Ollie is then sent there for being too pompous and Jas for being too exuberant. Worn down, eventually Mr Malone has had enough of teaching the class Mrs Griggs' way. He throws the book in the bin and gives the pupils a new exercise of his own - wearing blindfolds so they can feel free without worrying how people see them. It works - a blindfolded Lily is able to tell Matt she'll really miss him when he emigrates, which prompts Matt to tell her that he's not going anywhere. And Martha realises she's doing just fine with the personality she already has</desc>
