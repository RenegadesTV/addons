Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę</desc>

Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Młody mężczyzna ma raka języka. Specjaliści starają się usunąć guza tak, by pacjent nie stracił mowy. Widzowie poznają też historię dziewczyny, która cierpi z powodu bardzo wysuniętej żuchwy</desc>

Z kolei 40-letni Artur jest bohaterem pierwszej edycji "Sali operacyjnej", kiedy to jego waga wynosiła 150 kg. Po zabiegu schudł 55 kg i nadal trzyma formę. Artur stara się wykorzystać swoją wiedzę i doświadczenie, by pomagać innym. Przyjechał do szpitala na konsultację z dietetykiem, bo pomimo starań przestał chudnąć. Dodatkowym problemem jest wisząca skóra - pamiątka po utraconych kilogramach. Tymczasem Ela zdecydowała się wreszcie iść na zakupy po nowe ubrania</desc>

Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę</desc>

Z kolei 40-letni Artur jest bohaterem pierwszej edycji "Sali operacyjnej", kiedy to jego waga wynosiła 150 kg. Po zabiegu schudł 55 kg i nadal trzyma formę. Artur stara się wykorzystać swoją wiedzę i doświadczenie, by pomagać innym. Przyjechał do szpitala na konsultację z dietetykiem, bo pomimo starań przestał chudnąć. Dodatkowym problemem jest wisząca skóra - pamiątka po utraconych kilogramach. Tymczasem Ela zdecydowała się wreszcie iść na zakupy po nowe ubrania</desc>
