    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction.

And in Jordan, Hamza, who's eight, has a day out in town with his dad, and buys a lovely present for his baby sister, Mimi. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal</desc>

In Russia, seven-year-old Liza picks blueberries with her grandma - and helps turn them into delicious pancakes. In Ghana, Tyra, who's five, goes to the market with her mum and learns how to do the shopping. And in Jordan, Hamza, who's eight, has a day out in town with his dad, and buys a lovely present for his baby sister, Mimi. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal</desc>
