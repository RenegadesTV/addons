    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In today's episode, Maddie is sending a letter in the post to the CBeebies house. She finds out how posting a letter works as she follows the letter's journey from the post box to the sorting office and finally to the house. Using a special infrared light, Maddie shows us how stamps are scanned to tell if they are first or second class. Next, she visits a factory where colouring pencils are made. She finds out how the coloured crayon inside is made from clay and, using her slow-motion camera, we see the wooden shaft of the pencil being made.</desc>

She shows us how the surface tension of water changes when we add soap and how we can stop bubbles from bursting with our hands, and using her slow-motion camera, she shows how bubbles make a sphere shape. Next, Maddie heads to a factory where a party favourite is made - chocolate! We learn how chocolate starts out as a fruit, and we see the chocolates being made for an assortment box. Maddie also uses her special camera to see the super-fast robots that put the different chocolates into the right holes in their boxes.</desc>
