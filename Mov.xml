    <title lang="en">Whitney. "Can I Be Me"</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life(c)</desc>

So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!(n)</desc>
