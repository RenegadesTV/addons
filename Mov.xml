    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Nie ma nic złego w tym, by od czasu do czasu pozwolić sobie na szybki posiłek na mieście. Z tego założenia wychodzi też prowadząca, która tym razem odwiedza londyńskie fast-foody - od lokali serwujących tajwańskie kanapki, po egzotyczne dania z Karaibów. Prowadząca udowodni, że szybkie posiłki bez problemu możemy przygotować sami. Po powrocie z miasta w swojej kuchni zaprezentuje proste przepisy na pyszne śniadanie, lunch i obiad</desc>

Tannen przedstawiona jest w niej w fatalnym świetle. Bingum wie, że nie może zapobiec wydaniu książki, gdyż oznaczałoby to złamanie zasady wolności słowa. Jedynym wyjściem wydaje się wytoczenie procesu, podczas którego Tannen udowodni, że wszystko co napisała Lucas to bzdury. Wkrótce Jane wpada na genialny pomysł. Podczas rozprawy jej klienta wycofuje się jednak ze stawianych Lucas zarzutów, przez co ośmiesza swoją prawniczkę. Bingum postanawia dowiedzieć się, co się za tym kryje. Kim i Grayson reprezentują przed sądem transseksualistkę Allison Webb. Jeszcze jako mężczyzna zawarła ona związek małżeński. Żona Webb zmarła, nie pozostawiając testamentu. Teraz jej rodzice domagają się od Allison zwrotu rzeczy należących do córki. Nie mogą też zaakceptować faktu, że ich dziecko było związane z transseksualną osobą</desc>

Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. W tym odcinku Rachel odkrywa bliskie związki Londynu ze Wschodem, który doskonale odzwierciedla małżeństwo jej mamy rodowitej Austriaczki i pochodzącego z Melanezji taty. Razem z przyjaciółmi zamawia danie na wynos chińskie Dim Sum. Następnie we wschodnim Londynie Rachel pod okiem miejscowego szefa kuchni zgłębia tajniki egzotycznych dań, by później już we własnej kuchni przygotować orientalnego kurczaka z malezyjską sałatką i bułeczkami na parze(n)</desc>

Nagle uroczystość przerywa Hope Prentiss, która zarzuca Bingum, że zniszczyła jej małżeństwo, romansując z jej mężem. Oskarżenia są poważne, ale Jane jest przekonana, że to nieporozumienie. Co prawda nie pamięta nic ze swojej przeszłości, ale nie wierzy, by mogła związać się z żonatym mężczyzną. Hope pokazuje jednak zdjęcia jednoznacznie dowodzące, że Bingum spotykała się z Toddem Prentissem w motelu. Co więcej, ten policjant zniknął bez śladu osiem miesięcy temu, wkrótce po rzekomej randce z Jane. By rozwiązać tę zagadkę, Bingum musi lepiej poznaą swoją przeszłość. Tymczasem Grayson staje do sądowej batalii z byłym narzeczonym swojej obecnej dziewczyny Vanessy, Willem Caseyem. Musi przekonać go, by nie przenosił on fabryki do Meksyku, wskutek czego wszyscy amerykańscy pracownicy jego firmy stracą pracę.

    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Nie ma nic złego w tym, by od czasu do czasu pozwolić sobie na szybki posiłek na mieście. Z tego założenia wychodzi też prowadząca, która tym razem odwiedza londyńskie fast-foody - od lokali serwujących tajwańskie kanapki, po egzotyczne dania z Karaibów. Prowadząca udowodni, że szybkie posiłki bez problemu możemy przygotować sami. Po powrocie z miasta w swojej kuchni zaprezentuje proste przepisy na pyszne śniadanie, lunch i obiad</desc>

Tannen przedstawiona jest w niej w fatalnym świetle. Bingum wie, że nie może zapobiec wydaniu książki, gdyż oznaczałoby to złamanie zasady wolności słowa. Jedynym wyjściem wydaje się wytoczenie procesu, podczas którego Tannen udowodni, że wszystko co napisała Lucas to bzdury. Wkrótce Jane wpada na genialny pomysł. Podczas rozprawy jej klienta wycofuje się jednak ze stawianych Lucas zarzutów, przez co ośmiesza swoją prawniczkę. Bingum postanawia dowiedzieć się, co się za tym kryje. Kim i Grayson reprezentują przed sądem transseksualistkę Allison Webb. Jeszcze jako mężczyzna zawarła ona związek małżeński. Żona Webb zmarła, nie pozostawiając testamentu. Teraz jej rodzice domagają się od Allison zwrotu rzeczy należących do córki. Nie mogą też zaakceptować faktu, że ich dziecko było związane z transseksualną osobą</desc>

Dodatkowo przeszła kilka poważnych zabiegów - operację pękniętego płuca, wszczepienie rozrusznika serca i jego usunięcie. Po ostatniej operacji Joanna schudła 40 kilogramów. Niestety, pozostały jej fałdy skóry, które uniemożliwiają normalne funkcjonowanie. Nadmiar ciała naciska na przeponę i utrudnia oddychanie. Jej skóra jest bardzo cienka i boleśnie pęka przy delikatnym pociągnięciu. Joanna marzy o pozbyciu się nadmiaru skóry i przepukliny. Do tej pory lekarze odmawiali pomocy. W końcu udaje się znaleźć specjalistę, który podejmuje się wyzwania</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Stolica Anglii to tętniąca życiem metropolia. Zatłoczone chodniki i korki na ulicach to codzienność Londynu. Mieszkanie w wielkim mieście może być męczące, dlatego Rachel od czasu do czasu pozwala sobie na chwilę wytchnienia. Dziś wybiera się na przejażdżkę rowerową i odwiedza miejski ogródek znajomego. Po powrocie do domu przyrządza kolację, na którą składa się sałatka, ciasto oraz danie wegetariańskie</desc>

Początkowo otwarcie protestuje, potem jednak zgadza się asystować koleżance. Przypadek, którym się zajmują, jest bowiem bardzo ciekawy. Firma Clasky Phaumacerticals zdegradowała swoją pracowniczkę Charlotte Perkins ze względu na wiek, mimo że kobieta ma dopiero 34 lata. Kim i Jane starają się dowiedzieć, co tak naprawdę się za tym kryje. Tymczasem do Graysona zgłasza się młode małżeństwo, które niedawno kupiło od banku dom. Nie mogą w nim jednak zamieszkać, gdyż budynek jest... nawiedzony. Kent postanawia to sprawdzić. Przychodzi nocą do tego domu i spotyka w nim... Deb</desc>

Nagle uroczystość przerywa Hope Prentiss, która zarzuca Bingum, że zniszczyła jej małżeństwo, romansując z jej mężem. Oskarżenia są poważne, ale Jane jest przekonana, że to nieporozumienie. Co prawda nie pamięta nic ze swojej przeszłości, ale nie wierzy, by mogła związać się z żonatym mężczyzną. Hope pokazuje jednak zdjęcia jednoznacznie dowodzące, że Bingum spotykała się z Toddem Prentissem w motelu. Co więcej, ten policjant zniknął bez śladu osiem miesięcy temu, wkrótce po rzekomej randce z Jane. By rozwiązać tę zagadkę, Bingum musi lepiej poznaą swoją przeszłość. Tymczasem Grayson staje do sądowej batalii z byłym narzeczonym swojej obecnej dziewczyny Vanessy, Willem Caseyem. Musi przekonać go, by nie przenosił on fabryki do Meksyku, wskutek czego wszyscy amerykańscy pracownicy jego firmy stracą pracę. Dla Kenta to bardzo ważna sprawa, także ze względów osobistych(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Community Den.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Community on Solid Ground is a youth centre in Whalley Range. Before they took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common. That has dropped by 73% since Community on Solid Ground came along, the kids can hang out, play sports and have a place to go that means they aren't hanging around the streets. Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on. The Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics..... well nearly.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mildred's having fun jumping high into the air with Enid - using pirated magic to make the grass bouncy. Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Funella is very excited because it's time for the Furchester family dinner! Everyone will be heading to the dining room as soon as they've helped their guests. Mr Pickwood the beaver needs to know where some wood is, Captain Metimbers the pirate needs showing to her room and so does Matty the little mouse. With all this activity, Harvey P Dull wants to know who will look after the front desk if all the Furchesters are having a family dinner and with that Funella has moved his favourite chair in front of the desk and thanks him for helping out! The family all finally sit down for dinner, but when Furgus takes a seat he falls over. Mr Pickwood has eaten his chair! Furgus takes him to the garden and shows him the wood he CAN eat. Then Captain Metimbers interrupts, she's locked out of her treasure chest and needs Phoebe to open it. Next, Matty arrives and wants Elmo to get the bubble bath off the shelf for him as Elmo is so tall and he's so small. Then Funella hears Harvey P Dull welcoming someone WITHOUT furry arms. Funella puts some fur on Harvey's arms and shows him how to welcome guests properly. But now everyone is so busy that they can't have their family meal, it's a catastrophe! The Furchesters put their furry heads together and think, how can they have their family meal and not be interrupted by their guests? Fuzzawubba! Phoebe has a monster idea, why don't they invite their guests to dinner, after all everyone in the Furchester is like family!.</desc>
