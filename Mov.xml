    <title lang="en">The Autopsy of Jane Doe</title>
    <desc lang="en">Coroner Tommy Tilden and son Austin run a morgue and crematorium in Virginia. When the local sheriff brings in a body found in the basement of a home, it seems like just another open-and-shut case. As the autopsy proceeds however, they are left reeling as the inspection brings new revelations. Perfectly preserved on the outside, Jane Doe seems to have been the victim of a horrific ritualistic torture. Tommy and Austin begin to piece together these gruesome discoveries, as an unnatural force takes hold of the crematorium.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a great day. In Jordan, eight-year-old Hamza makes lunch with his mum. In Vietnam, Truc, who is seven, makes paper butterflies at school and wins a relay race. And in Italy, seven-year-old Mario and his brother and sister spend the day at their grandma's house, dressing up and eating ice cream. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>
