    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Light-hearted documentary shedding light on the lives of people whose extravagant tastes often leave their parents or significant others substantially out of pocket. These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiance as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.</desc>

On offer is a prize bigger than The Great Wall of China - in style if not in size - it's the Remotely Funny hoodie?. And it's made in China! The contenders' game faces in Bedroom Bonanza show that they will stop at nothing to win those sweet samojis? but how happy would your mum be if you brought back a pair of her knickers as a something that belongs to someone else item? Lovers of dogs should tune in for Loo Tube but lovers of music should probably avoid today's parent craziness in Remotely Funny families! Lovers of all-action game shows only need to lock their eyes to the screen to find out who will shine at samoji-winning and who will ultimately buzz the quickest in The Decider?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In today's episode, Maddie is relaxing at home, playing games and watching television. She shows us how a television screen works using millions of tiny squares called pixels. Using her special microscope camera, Maddie shows us how a pixel can make any colour from just three coloured lights - red, blue and green. Next she visits a factory where carpet is made. Maddie follows the journey that wool takes, from shearing a sheep to going through the factory, to end up in the carpets we have at home. Maddie uses her special slow-motion camera to show us how the different coloured threads are woven together on a loom to make a carpet.</desc>
