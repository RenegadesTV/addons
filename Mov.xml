    <desc lang="pl">Kontynuacja historii z poprzedniego odcinka. W wyniku wieloletniego leczenia sterydami Joanna cierpiała z powodu przepukliny i nadmiaru skóry. Zmagała się również z niewydolnością serca i innych ważnych organów oraz uciążliwą astmą. W swoim życiu przeszła wiele poważnych operacji. Teraz budzi się po najpoważniejszym z zabiegów, jakim ją poddano. Widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będzie wyglądała rekonwalescencja Joanny po długiej i skomplikowanej operacji. Przekonają się, czy kobieta odzyska pełnię zdrowia, spełni sen o normalnym życiu i wreszcie odzyska kontrolę nad własnym ciałem. Niestety, dotąd lekarze odmawiali przeprowadzenia ryzykownego zabiegu, jednak determinacja marzącej o zdobywaniu górskich szczytów kobiety okazała się silniejsza</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Do jednej z ważniejszych metod pomocy pacjentom ze schorzeniami serca należą tzw. bajpasy. Są one wszczepiane w miejsce zwężonych lub zamkniętych naczyń krwionośnych, dzięki czemu zapewniają prawidłowy przepływ krwi i pracę serca. Kardiochirurg dr Przemysław Szałański jako jedyny na świecie potrafi przeprowadzić ten zabieg bez rozcinania mostka i użycia sztucznego płucoserca. Niestety, jednak nie u wszystkich pacjentów jest to możliwe. Nowatorską metodę można zastosować u Urszuli. Inaczej sytuacja wygląda w przypadku Wacława. Badania wykazują, że mężczyzna jest o krok od zawału. Konieczny staje się zabieg wymagający rozcięcia całego mostka</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Kontynuacja historii z poprzedniego odcinka. W wyniku wieloletniego leczenia sterydami Joanna cierpiała z powodu przepukliny i nadmiaru skóry. Zmagała się również z niewydolnością serca i innych ważnych organów oraz uciążliwą astmą. W swoim życiu przeszła wiele poważnych operacji. Teraz budzi się po najpoważniejszym z zabiegów, jakim ją poddano. Widzowie dowiedzą się, jak będzie wyglądała rekonwalescencja Joanny po długiej i skomplikowanej operacji. Przekonają się, czy kobieta odzyska pełnię zdrowia, spełni sen o normalnym życiu i wreszcie odzyska kontrolę nad własnym ciałem. Niestety, dotąd lekarze odmawiali przeprowadzenia ryzykownego zabiegu, jednak determinacja marzącej o zdobywaniu górskich szczytów kobiety okazała się silniejsza</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Do jednej z ważniejszych metod pomocy pacjentom ze schorzeniami serca należą tzw. bajpasy. Są one wszczepiane w miejsce zwężonych lub zamkniętych naczyń krwionośnych, dzięki czemu zapewniają prawidłowy przepływ krwi i pracę serca. Kardiochirurg dr Przemysław Szałański jako jedyny na świecie potrafi przeprowadzić ten zabieg bez rozcinania mostka i użycia sztucznego płucoserca. Niestety, jednak nie u wszystkich pacjentów jest to możliwe. Nowatorską metodę można zastosować u Urszuli. Inaczej sytuacja wygląda w przypadku Wacława. Badania wykazują, że mężczyzna jest o krok od zawału. Konieczny staje się zabieg wymagający rozcięcia całego mostka</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rank the Prank - pranking Hollywood style! Today our pesky pranksters are Prank 360 (Zhara and Sara) and Gladiators (Hadrian and Luke) who team up with SFX specialists Marc Reichel and Andy Antoine and stunt performer Devon Slack to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. Today teams invade an office building and for unsuspecting targets, it's going to be anything but another... day at the office! It's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's a battle between the head-scratching 'Office Switcheroo' and the super-charged 'Trainwreck Hallway'! Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, Marc, Andy and Devon have planned a MEGA PRANK packed with ninja power! The setting is a martial arts dojo, complete with flying rigs, flying crates and flying people! Will the targets flap their wings and take flight too? One thing's for sure, this MEGA PRANK is gonna be fly!.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">2016 is the BBC's 'Year of the Story' and as part of the celebration, the award winning Horrible Histories returns with a one-off special about Staggering Storytellers. Who wrote the first detective novel? When were books invented? Why do we like stories so much? In its own distinctive and irreverently accurate style, the episode takes a look at some of literature's greatest works and history's wackiest writers. Along the way we see the development of storytelling technology; we learn how a party at Lord Byron's house led to the writing of the Gothic masterpiece Frankenstein, and how Charles Dickens was the Harry Styles of his day. Spanning 3,000 years of recorded history we take a look at the funny and ridiculous ways some of our finest writers cured their writing block - did you know Tennyson used to pretend to go the loo as a party trick? Plus, of course, our trusty host Rattus to guide the way.</desc>
