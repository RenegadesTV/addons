    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.(n)</desc>

When their son is killed fighting on the frontlines however, everything changes. They begin pouring their rage and grief into postcards emblazoned with anti-Nazi slogans, risking everything to get their messages of protest across the city. This seemingly small act of subversion rattles the regime, including a police inspector (Daniel Brühl) who will not rest until the culprits have been caught.</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit.(n)</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit.(n)</desc>
