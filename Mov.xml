    <desc lang="en">(2004) Jonathan Demme's remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 thriller is updated to the Gulf War, with Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) as a member of a patrol saved by Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber). Shaw was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery and is now standing for vice-president, under the stern eye of his controlling mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep).

Marco, however, keeps having disturbing nightmares and discovers he is being controlled not by brain-washing but by implanted chips. As he attempts to unravel the mystery and stop Eleanor's plot, so she is equally determined that her son will not be thwarted(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Michael Mann updates the groundbreaking television crime series he created in the 1980s with this stylish thriller. Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) and Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) are two police detectives working undercover in Florida; Tubbs is smart, cool, and resourceful, while Crockett has his own way of doing things, though he stays close enough to the rules to stay out of trouble. Their latest assignment is to get the goods on Arcangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar), a local drug kingpin whose men are believed to be responsible for a handful of recent murders. In order to infiltrate Montoya's operation, Tubbs and Crockett pose as powerboat racers willing to use their talents to pilot drug-smuggling ships for the right price. The detectives' ruse works, but as they dig deeper into Montoya's inner circle, they become involved in a dangerous operation that will take them to Haiti and Cuba, where neither the Miami Police Force nor the United States government can help them if things go wrong. Crockett also begins walking a risky path when he begins an affair with Isabella (Gong Li), a woman high up in Montoya's organization. Miami Vice marked Michael Mann's third consecutive directorial effort with Jamie Foxx after Ali and Collateral(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Intruders</title>
    <desc lang="en">A mysterious beast stalks innocent children in this thriller from Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. In the 1980s, Juan (Izan Corchero) is a young boy with an active imagination and a talent for writing stories. However, he is being terrorized by a strange creature that lurks in his room late at night and doesn't seem to have a face. Juan's mother Luisa (Pilar Lopez de Ayala) is skeptical at first, but comes to believe demonic forces are at work and asks a local priest (Daniel Bruehl) to chase the spirits out. However, it soon becomes obvious Satan is not the one to blame for the horrible visits. Three decades later, John (Clive Owen) and Susanna (Carice van Houten) are the parents of Mia (Ella Purnell), a 13-year-old girl. John is fiercely protective of his daughter, and when she's attacked in her room late one night, he's determined to find whoever or whatever is responsible. As it happens, Mia is being visited by Hollowface, a monster similar to the one who was stalking Juan, and he's just as difficult to frighten away. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's first directorial project after his commercial breakthrough with 28 Weeks Later, Intruders was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Survivors</title>
    <desc lang="en">Though not officially acknowleged at the time of its telecast, the made-for-TV movie The Last Survivors was a rehash of the 1957 theatrical feature Abandon Ship; both in fact were based on the same true story. A typhoon at sea has sunk a ship, leaving Alexander Holmes (Martin Sheen) as the highest ranking officer to survive. Commandeering a crowded lifeboat, Holmes must face the fact that the tiny vessel is in danger of floundering itself--and there's another typhoon on the way. Thus is Holmes forced to "play God", decided who among the passengers will allowed to remain in the lifeboat, and who will be cast overboard. Broadcast by NBC, The Last Survivors debuted on March 4, 1975. ~Saw Film/TV Guide/Marrill/Internet/Expert(n)</desc>

Upon arriving at the empty apartment of his old friend Nick, the unassuming Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is troubled to hear the voice of his missing friend's next door neighbor Lindsay (Lucy Liu) expressing concern as to Nick's safety and whereabouts. When Slevin ventures into Lindsay's apartment only to be greeted by the uninviting fist of a thuggish mob henchman, he quickly realizes that Nick is indeed in grave danger. Soon summoned by the big boss and accused of being the deeply indebted Nick, Slevin's attempts to prove his identity are foiled by the fact that his wallet had been stolen upon arrival in the city. With time running out and a complex plot to assassinate one of the city's most powerful crime bosses slowly coming into focus, the arrival of a notorious hit-man named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) forces Slevin to step up his desperate search and reclaim his identity before he's forced to pay a debt that could cost him his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Candles on Bay Street</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1999 bestseller by K.C. McKinnon, this touching Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation stars Alicia Silverstone as Dee Dee, a single mom and professional candlemaker who returns to her Maine hometown after a lengthy absence. Having left town with a somewhat sullied reputation, she returns with apparently the best of intentions--bringing her 12-year-old son Trooper (Matthew Knight) along for the sentimental journey. Dee Dee's reappearance is initially met with hostility by veterinarian Lydia, whose husband (and coworker) Sam had once been Dee Dee's sweetheart. Ultimately, however, Lydia warms up to both her "rival" and her son--just before Dee Dee poignantly reveals the real reason for her unexpected homecoming. Filmed for television on location in Nova Scotia, Candles on Bay Street was first broadcast by CBS on November 26, 2006</desc>

    <title lang="en">Magic of Ordinary Days</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from the story by Ann Howard Creel, this Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation is set in rural Colorado in 1944. After she becomes pregnant by a departing soldier, Livy Dune, the wealthy, pampered daughter of a Denver minister (Daryl Shuttleworth), is forced to forever abandon her hopes of becoming an archeologist. To shield her from further scandal, Livy's father ships her off to a remote farm and arranges her marriage with shy farmer Ray Singleton (Skeet Ulrich), who is struggling to live up to his proscribed responsibilities to the wartime government. Clearly depressed by the situation, Livy does as well as she can to be polite and civil to her husband and his sister Martha (Mare Winningham), but it is clear that she'd rather be dead than married to a man she doesn't even know. For Ray's part, he is unfailingly generous and supplicative, but the realization that Livy doesn't want him makes him feel more inadequate than ever. With almost painful slowness, the two lost souls finally come to love and cherish one another, while each one also learns to forgive themselves for their own imagined shortcomings. A subplot involves the couple's relationship with a brace of well-educated Japanese girls living in a local internment camp. The Magic of Ordinary Days made its CBS debut on January 30, 2005</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Adapted from the bestselling novel by Richard Paul Evans, the made-for-TV The Locket stars Vanessa Redgrave as Esther Huish, an elderly, embittered resident of a nursing home. Into Esther's life comes young attendant Michael Keddington (Chad Willett), who like Esther has been forced to live a life of self-sacrifice and shattered dreams. Ever since his father deserted the family, Michael has cared for his ailing mother, putting his chances for college on what seems to be permanent hold. Now that his mother is dead, Michael is facing another crisis over which he has no control: The domineering father of Michael's fiancée has refused to bless the approaching wedding. Even so, Michael makes it his mission in life to make Esther's final years as comfortable and rewarding as possible; thus, he dedicates himself to locating Esther's long-lost love, using only a faded picture in a locket as his guide. As it turns out, it is Esther who "saves" Michael when the young man is accused of murdering another nursing-home resident. A CBS "Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentation, The Locket first aired on December 8, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A heroin trafficker whose wife was abducted and murdered hires a haunted private investigator to track down the men who killed her in this brooding crime drama starring Liam Neeson. Matt Scudder (Neeson) was an NYPD cop having a quiet drink in a Washington Heights bar when a pair of armed robbers came in guns blazing. Giving chase, Scudder kills the robbers in the street, though a stray bullet turns a heroic moment tragic. Devastated, Scudder subsequently goes to work as an unlicensed private detective, working just outside of the law and surviving on generous gifts offered in exchange for his services. Now, tasked with rooting out the sadistic thugs who brutally murdered the wife of a wealthy drug dealer (Dan Stevens), Scudder scours the bars and back alleys of New York City in search of his elusive targets -- and the closer he gets, the more apparent it becomes that they are something much more sinister than your typical kidnappers</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this throwback monster movie from producer Dean Devlin (Independence Day, Godzilla), David Arquette plays the son of a deceased mine owner, returning home to the economically depressed hamlet of Prosperity, AZ, after a long absence. His arrival coincides with a toxic waste accident in the local water supply, the result of a barrel jostled loose from the back of a passing truck. Unfortunately, said water source abuts the region's least-popular attraction: an exotic spider farm. The farm's owner (Tom Noonan) becomes the first victim when the spiders, already possessed of keen predatory abilities, grow to the size of small automobiles. Laying in wait underground, they begin picking off the town's pet and ostrich population, and soon it's all the local sheriff (Kari Wuhrer) can do to raise the alarm before the siege begins. Eight Legged Freaks was produced under the working title "Arac Attack," but the politically conscious producers, concerned the title sounded too much like "Iraq Attack," went with Arquette's brainstorm as a safer alternative</desc>

To make ends meet, Carson takes a night watchman job at the Mayflower, a massive department store that was badly damaged in an arson attack some time ago. While on his rounds, he starts to catch sight of startling images featuring violent visions of self-mutilation in the abandoned shop's various mirrors. Initially he ascribes his experiences to being alone in unsettling isolation at night. However, when his family also starts to be affected, he is convinced they are all in danger. Clues to what's happening come in the form of mysterious references to 'Esseker' and Carson's discovery of the building's original purpose. And, once he's learnt the shocking truth, can he stop the Mayflower's evil influence before anyone else gets hurt?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Clean and Sober</title>
    <desc lang="en">The directorial debut of Glenn Gordon Caron, the creator of the television series Moonlighting (1985-89), this intense, gritty drama was received as one of the best-ever cinematic treatments of substance abuse. Michael Keaton stars as Daryl Poynter, a hustling, successful Philadelphia real estate agent who has become addicted to cocaine. He's already got problems, including nearly a $100,000 embezzled from his employer and lost on the stock market, when he wakes up one morning with a young woman dead in his bed from a coke overdose. His company is asking questions about the missing funds, and the dead girl's father is plastering his neighborhood with posters accusing Daryl of being a murderer, so he decides to hide out in an anonymous drug treatment program. There, however, Daryl runs into tough-minded counselor and former addict Craig (Morgan Freeman), who has heard all of Daryl's lies and tricks before. Daryl also finds romance with an abused fellow addict, Charlie Standers (Kathy Baker), and understanding with his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor (M. Emmet Walsh)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">K-19: The Widowmaker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Harrison Ford steps into a different sort of heroic action role in this suspense-drama, based on a true story. In 1961, with America and the Soviet Union locked in the bitter struggle of the Cold War, the Soviets initiated a crash course to build and launch their first ballistic nuclear submarine to stand against America's seagoing nuclear arsenal. While Capt. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) had initially been put in charge of the sub, after lengthy delays and numerous mechanical failures, military chief Marshal Zelentstov (Joss Ackland) dropped Polenin down a rung in the chain of command and named tough-as-nails Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) commander of the ship. While Polenin's pride is stung when Vostrikov is named skipper, his greatest concern is that the ship is unsafe and not yet ready for launch; Vostrikov and Zelentstov supersede his objections, and the sub sets sail on schedule. However, Polenin's fears prove to be horribly prescient; as they sail beneath the waters near the United States' Eastern Seaboard, the ship's nuclear reactor goes haywire at sea, and experiences a near meltdown. Polenin and Vostrikov realize that a nuclear disaster aboard the sub is a very real possibility, which could not only send a deadly dose of radiation across America's East Coast, but could result in an explosion (and subsequent missile release) that would likely launch World War III. The adversarial Polenin and Vostrikov must set aside their differences and sacrifice their own safety in the interest of protecting innocent lives around the world. K-19: The Widowmaker also stars Peter Sarsgaard, John Shrapnel, and Donald Sumpter(n)</desc>
