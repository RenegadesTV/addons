    <title lang="en">New Wave: Dare to be Different</title>
    <desc lang="en">In August, 1982, a small group of radio visionaries at WLIR Long Island knew they couldn't compete with the mega radio stations in New York City. With one brave decision, they changed the sound of radio forever. Program Director Denis McNamara, the crew at the station and the biggest artists of the era tell the story of how they battled the FCC, the record labels, mega-radio and all the conventional rules to create a musical movement that brought the New Wave to America - including bands like U2, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode and Blondie.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Twórcy programu odwiedzają miejsca, w których odbywają się najciekawsze wakacyjne wydarzenia. Zawitają zarówno do największych polskich miast, jak i mniejszych ośrodków. Pojawią się na imprezach plenerowych, w klubach, na plażach, basenach, aquaparkach czy zawodach sportowych. Prowadzący zapytają napotkane tam osoby o to, jak spędzają lato i gdzie wypoczywają. Nie zabraknie rozmów z gwiazdami i gości specjalnych.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy wishes he had a cartoon, little brother who wants to play all the time. Not a big sister who gets mad at him. Nodding off, a dream bubble above his head shows Roy playing with Zip-a little, cartoon brother. When Roy wakes up, he is thrilled to find that Zip has hopped out of his dream and into reality. But things don't quite go according to plan! Roy steps out of his room to find an upturned laundry basket on the landing and clothes everywhere! In the kitchen, Zip wolfs down a cake, and out in the garden he creates a grass whirlwind over Bill's newly mowed lawn. While Roy cleans up Zip's mess with a rake, he tells Tristan all about his cartoon brother who escaped from his dream and is causing havoc. Roy realises that having a cartoon brother who wants to play all the time, might not always be such fun. Roy knows they have to get Zip back to Dreamland and wonders - What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, The Messer is wreaking havoc, until Wonder Roy puts a halt to his shenanigans by bringing in The Messer's mother, wisely working out that everyone gets homesick. Back in reality, Tristan and Roy work together to show Zip what he's missing in Dreamland? endless cakes and endless fun! Zip leaps onto Roy's bed and bounces into the dream bubble. Lesson learned, Roy tidies the bedroom for Becky. He finishes, just in the nick of time, as Becky arrives home with some cake to share with her favourite, little cartoon brother.(n)</desc>
