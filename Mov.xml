    <title lang="en">Whitney. "Can I Be Me"</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life(n)</desc>

In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal</desc>
