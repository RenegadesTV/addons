Botanist Dr Martin Harris is attending a science conference in Berlin when he realises he's left his papers at the airport and jumps in a cab and sets off to retrieve them. But en route he's involved in a massive pile-up that leaves him unconscious and hospitalised. Coming round, he discovers that no one knows who he is, and he has no proof of his identity. Worse, back at the hotel, his wife Elizabeth not only claims not to recognise him but also says another man is her husband. Bewildered, Harris sets out to unpick what the hell is going on, with the help of taxi driver Gina, who rescued him from the accident. And the further he investigates, the clearer it becomes that something is seriously amiss - and that dark forces are out to put a permanent end to his search for the truth...

The Simpsons attend the annual rodeo at Waterville State Penitentiary after a disappointing visit to an Apron Expo, and Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a painful run-in with a bull. While at the prison, Marge meets a handsome convict Jack (voice of Michael Keaton), and while she's told he has such a reputation Bob Dylan wrote a protest song to keep him behind bars, Marge is certain he has a sensitive side that ought to be nurtured. Marge persuades the Warden (voice of Charles Napier) to let her teach an art class at the prison, and Jack soon becomes her star pupil. Swayed by Jack's charm, good looks and talent, Marge speaks out in favor of his parole, and once he's freed, helps him land a job at Springfield Elementary School, where Principal Skinner (voice of Harry Shearer) hires him to create a mural celebrating the school's motto, "Puma Pride." Jack's finished product, however, isn't what Marge or Skinner has in mind, and soon Jack lapses back into his criminal lifestyle. "Pokey Mom" first aired on January 14, 2001(n)</desc>

The Duncans are still stricken with grief when they're approached by Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro), who makes a startling proposal -- Wells operates an experimental fertility clinic, and he's developed a technique by which an embryo could be created from cloned cells taken from their late son, which would be implanted in Jessie's womb. Nine months later, Jessie would give birth to a child exactly like Adam in every way. While Paul and Jessie are initially shocked by this suggestion, in time they decide to give Adam the chance to grow to adulthood and they take up Wells on his offer. The cloned Adam is born healthy and content, and all seems to be well until the child begins to approach his eighth birthday, when events take a startling turn(n)</desc>

With a party to organise the gang get to work - Matilda's brother Jack and sisters Megan and Holly take shopping to another level as they speed along the river Thames on a high-performance rib to pick up supplies. Matilda's in charge of the party food: build your own spicy sausage pitta bread sandwiches with zingy yoghurt sauce and popcorn cakes. The popcorn cakes idea came from Scarlet, a Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch viewer who emailed it to Matilda's Food Blog. Great food, friends and fun, and the party finishing with a bang when the guys play an explosive game with a watermelon - parties don't get much better!.</desc>

Martin and Craig have a colourful, and crunchy, Tabletop Activity - rainbow salad in a jar! And we'll be exploring the globe in an animated fact-finding mission! There are lots more Send-ins from CBeebies viewers, telling the clubhouse crew everything they've been up to. Speedy Let's Goer Alexander joins Joanna outside the clubhouse in his cool go-kart! And Avril is putting on a tasty world food party with her friends! Plus everyone's favourite singing and dancing with the ever-so-catchy Get Set, Let's Go! song, and the boogie-brilliant Club Dance.</desc>
