Determined to stay in 'showbiz', he invests his last few dollars in setting up a TV Channel, number 6597423 in the listings. With a brand new channel and nothing to put on it, Larry then makes the classic mistake of employing Diddy Dick and Dom to take charge of programming. Diddy Dick and Dom have launched their very own TV channel! Watch 'The Great Diddy Bake Off', it's feeding time in the 'Diddy Brother' house and someone's in for a big surprise in 'Just For Pranks!'.(n)</desc>
