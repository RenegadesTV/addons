    <desc lang="pl">Francuski serial kryminalny opowiadający o pracy w wydziale paryskiej policji, który specjalizuje się w poszukiwaniu sprawców morderstw. Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Nic im nie mówi o swojej chorobie, ale za to stara się spędzić jak najwięcej czasu z rodziną. Tymczasem otrzymuje pewną propozycję: weźmie udział w eksperymentalnej terapii w zamian za podjęcie się ściśle tajnej misji. Jego pierwszym zadaniem jest pochwycenie głównego handlarza narkotyków, który do tej pory był poza zasięgiem policji. Vincent musi tak działać, aby odnieść sukces, ale nie wzbudzić podejrzeń swojej siostry, policjantki Juliette. Skomplikowane śledztwo wymaga od niego dyskrecji, a zachowanie tajemnicy w towarzystwie siostry, córki i byłej żony staje się nie lada wyzwaniem</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

    <desc lang="pl">Vincent Libérati, najlepszy agent francuskiego kontrwywiadu, przebywa na misji w Afryce, kiedy dowiaduje się, że ma guza mózgu. Postanawia zakończyć pracę w tajnej służbie i ostatnie miesiące życia spędzić w Marsylii, niedaleko swojej córki Loli i byłej żony Aleksandry, która tymczasem układa sobie życie z miejscowym adwokatem. Nic im nie mówi o swojej chorobie, ale za to stara się spędzić jak najwięcej czasu z rodziną. Tymczasem otrzymuje pewną propozycję: weźmie udział w eksperymentalnej terapii w zamian za podjęcie się ściśle tajnej misji. Jego pierwszym zadaniem jest pochwycenie głównego handlarza narkotyków, który do tej pory był poza zasięgiem policji. Vincent musi tak działać, aby odnieść sukces, ale nie wzbudzić podejrzeń swojej siostry, policjantki Juliette. Skomplikowane śledztwo wymaga od niego dyskrecji, a zachowanie tajemnicy w towarzystwie siostry, córki i byłej żony staje się nie lada wyzwaniem</desc>

Kobieta pracuje w stolarni i wychowuje samotnie 14-letnią Nikolę, przez co nie miała do tej pory czasu, aby zająć się sobą. Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać?

    <desc lang="pl">Francuski serial kryminalny opowiadający o pracy w wydziale paryskiej policji, który specjalizuje się w poszukiwaniu sprawców morderstw. Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

Jak się okazuje, przebojowa, towarzyska i pozytywnie nastawiona do życia w przeszłości została też oszukana przez swoją wielką miłość, wypierając tym samym wszystkie własne potrzeby. To przykre doświadczenie spowodowało, że do dziś boi się zaufać mężczyznom. Małgosia chciałaby na nowo poczuć się kobieco i atrakcyjnie, a kto wie - może także znów się zakochać? Brak jej jednak pomysłu, jak się za to zabrać. Eksperci programu pomogą jej odnaleźć w sobie kobietę i uwierzyć, że spotka ją jeszcze wielka miłość(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Co zrobić z tą figurą?</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">21-letnia Paulina z Warszawy pracuje w call center. Dziewczyna jest szczęśliwą matką 1,5-rocznej córeczki, niedługo ma też wziąć ślub z Dominikiem, ojcem dziecka. Największym problemem Pauliny jest jednak jej ciało. Jej figura po ciąży bardzo się zmieniła i trudno jej zaakceptować ten fakt. Jej rozmiar powiększył się z 34 na 42.Praca, wychowanie dziecka i prowadzenie domu powodują, że Paulina nie ma czasu i sił, aby zająć się sobą. We własnej skórze czuje się tak źle, że wycofała się nawet z życia towarzyskiego. Marzy, aby znów stać się taka jak dawniej - przebojowa, towarzyska i pełną energii. Widzowie przekonają się, czy uda jej się osiągnąć ten cel i czy problemy z figurą, to jedyny powód zmartwień w życiu Pauliny(n)</desc>

Today our pesky pranksters are Dukafundis (Markus and Ellysa) and 'Very Intelligent Pranksters' (Evan and Ashazia) who team up with digital effects wizard Hassan Aziz and SFX specialists Marc Reichel and Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. The teams take over a bowling alley and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's strike three for the targets when Markus and Ellysa's 'Haunted Alley' dukes it out with Evan and Ashazia's 'Hotdog Bowler'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, the effectors have planned the ultimate MEGA PRANK at a car wash featuring a dirty car, a nervous driver and a meteor shower! Our 'target' may be able to avoid the meteor but will mom's car be able to do the same? One thing's for sure, this explosively entertaining mega prank strikes comedy gold!</desc>

Today teams invade an office building and for unsuspecting targets, it's going to be anything but another... day at the office! It's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's a battle between the head-scratching 'Office Switcheroo' and the super-charged 'Trainwreck Hallway'! Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, Marc, Andy and Devon have planned a MEGA PRANK packed with ninja power! The setting is a martial arts dojo, complete with flying rigs, flying crates and flying people! Will the targets flap their wings and take flight too? One thing's for sure, this MEGA PRANK is gonna be fly!(n)</desc>
