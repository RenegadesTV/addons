    <title lang="en">68 Kill</title>
    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".(n)</desc>

He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

Jane enjoys unseasonably cloudless skies and sparkling seas as the route takes in the puffin-packed Treshnish Islands and Fingal's Cave on Staffa, the mythic rock formation that famously inspired Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture. The excursion is rounded off with some traditional trappings, from ceilidhs and weaving to haggis-making.</desc>

It aired for one season in prime time on ABC, but those episodes were repeated on Saturday mornings on three networks off and on over the next 20 years.

Once a year the setting sun lights up the water, making it glow like fire for just a few special minutes. This is called Firefall, and if there isn't enough water from the melting snow, Firefall doesn't happen. Unfortunately, Grandmaster Glitch has built a snow princess at the top of the fall and is using an ice machine to stop her melting. When the Go Jetters arrive to watch Firefall, they see that there is no water falling down! Can the team save snowy Princess Glorinda and Firefall?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's Christmas Eve at the Furchester Hotel and Big Bird and Count Von Count are visiting Elmo. Big Bird realises he's forgotten to tell Santa that he's staying at The Furchester Hotel for Christmas and is worried that Santa won't know where to deliver his presents. Elmo and the other guests haven't told Santa either and become really worried. Will Santa know where to deliver their presents? It's too late to get a letter to the North Pole, so the Furchesters try to distract all the guests with their Christmas activities. However, every mention of Santa makes everyone worried again, they don't finish any of the activities they started. And Phoebe is disappointed that she can't enjoy her Christmas the way the Furchesters planned it. With the help of Harvey P Dull, Elmo and Big Bird realise there's more to Christmas than presents, and that sharing traditions and celebrating together is what makes Christmas so special.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Grandmaster Glitch has taken his teddy, Cuddles, to Ilulissat in Greenland to show him the sights, but Cuddles falls out of Grim HQ and gets stuck in the snow. The Grimbots melt the ice around Cuddles, and Glitch then uses Grim HQ to pull up the massive chunk of ice and carry it into the air. The Go Jetters are also in Ilulissat trying to spot some whales. They learn that Ilulissat means iceberg and that an iceberg is a huge chunk of ice which forms on land and then breaks off into the sea. Just then, Glitch's heavy iceberg falls from Grim HQ and starts sliding down the hill towards the town. The Go Jetters need to stop it and protect the town!</desc>

Big Bird realises he's forgotten to tell Santa that he's staying at The Furchester Hotel for Christmas and is worried that Santa won't know where to deliver his presents. Elmo and the other guests haven't told Santa either and become really worried. Will Santa know where to deliver their presents? It's too late to get a letter to the North Pole, so the Furchesters try to distract all the guests with their Christmas activities. However, every mention of Santa makes everyone worried again, they don't finish any of the activities they started. And Phoebe is disappointed that she can't enjoy her Christmas the way the Furchesters planned it. With the help of Harvey P Dull, Elmo and Big Bird realise there's more to Christmas than presents, and that sharing traditions and celebrating together is what makes Christmas so special.(n)</desc>
