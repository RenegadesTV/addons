W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

    <desc lang="pl">Kolejna odsłona serialu o perypetiach pięknej modelki Deb, która zginęła w wypadku samochodowym i powróciła na ziemię w ciele pulchnej prawniczki Jane Bingum (Brooke Elliott). Pod nową postacią dwie osobowości kobiety muszą nauczyć się koegzystować. Deb, dla której przed wypadkiem świat koncentrował się wokół nieskazitelnego wyglądu, przechodzi równie spektakularną wewnętrzną metamorfozę. Jane reprezentuje czirliderkę, która twierdzi, że była prześladowana przez kolegę z zespołu. Owen mobilizuje rodzinę do walki przeciwko polityce rządu, z kolei Teri ukrywa Paula przed wierzycielami(n)</desc>

The kids are heading to Bristol to a Mixed Recycling Facility, known as MRF, where what we throw away is sorted by hand on fast flowing conveyor belts. The kids are amazed to see 250 tonnes of waste being processed each day and they are shocked when they realise they will be expected to join the teams of people going through our waste. Are they all willing to get their own hands dirty to dig out the valuable recycling? And with a very strict boss to report to, how will they cope doing the first day of real work in their lives?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">There's a storm brewing outside and it's making everyone jumpy. Roy tries to help with the snacks for Becky's movie night but a loud rumble of thunder makes him leap and sprawl across the ceiling! Bill and Maura explain that it's normal to be afraid of the storm and that they're perfectly safe, but when the lights go out, Roy whirls into a cartoon panic! He wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy and Finn discover Nighty Knight has cut the power to Toonville and is using his giant shadow to scare the inhabitants. The dynamic duo quickly reveal his trick and send him on his way. Back in reality, Roy is inspired to generate a cartoon light-bulb to keep the dark at bay. Then, when Becky's movie night is cancelled, Roy uses his stretchy skills to entertain everyone with a shadow puppet show. Even when the lights come back on, everyone agrees that they don't need a movie night - Roy is the only entertainment they need!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">So Awkward</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">The Salford Curse.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Jas decides to follow in her dad's footsteps and try out for the junior hockey team. Mr Salford was a legendary hockey goalie in his time at the school. When the try-outs are cancelled due to the coach not being available, Mr Salford steps in and offers his services as coach. Mrs Griggs is horrified - she could do without the chaos he inevitably brings with him - but he won't take no for an answer. Jas and her father are really superstitious and when things start going wrong Jas thinks she's jinxed, and then that she's passed on the jinx to her dad. When she's not picked as goalie for the team Jas is actually relieved - it must mean she's still jinxed and hasn't passed on the jinx to her dad. Eventually Jas does need to play in goal, but when she saves a crucial penalty she and her dad are delighted to realise they are not jinxed after all, just accident-prone! Meanwhile, Martha &amp; Ollie get paranoid that Cassie &amp; Maxwell are usurping them. They've taken over their favourite nook in the library and when they turn up to do their regular security check on Mrs Rennison's computer Cassie and Maxwell have already been there and done it. They decide they've got to get their own back and they sabotage a fizzy drinks maker Cassie and Maxwell have created to provide refreshments at the hockey match. They turn up the CO2 dial and everyone gets very burpy! Lily is feeling abandoned by her friends - they all seem too busy to hang out with her. Matt advises her that a big gesture could do the trick. When she unfurls a giant banner during the hockey match declaring her admiration for her friends it's really embarrassing. It does prompt Martha and Ollie to do the right thing, though, and confess to Cassie and Maxwell that they sabotaged their fizzy drinks machine and does inspire Jas to save that crucial penalty(n)</desc>
