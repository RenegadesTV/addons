    <desc lang="pl">Znaleziono młodą kobietę drastycznie okaleczoną na ołtarzu w małej kaplicy. Mord rytualny zostaje natychmiast przypisany seryjnemu zabójcy, Emmanuelowi Pasquetowi, zwanemu Inkwizytorem. Cain sądzi jednak, że za sprawą stoi jego naśladowca. Wkrótce okazuje się, że intuicja go nie zawiodła. Inkwizytor nie znosi, gdy ktoś go naśladuje. Powraca więc, by zlikwidować swojego rywala. Liczy, że doprowadzi go do niego Lucie. Świadomie pomaga mu też Cain, który naprowadza go na trop Abla, męża ofiary. Detektyw zna Patricka Libansky'ego. Poznał go przed 5 laty w ośrodku, gdzie odzyskiwał siły po wypadku. Stoczyli tam wtedy psychiczny pojedynek</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mildred's having fun jumping high into the air with Enid - using pirated magic to make the grass bouncy. Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school(n)</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>

Roy gives it a go and is delighted with the results. Maura, Becky, Bill and Joan are all amazed with the work Roy does on changing their looks. Roy is eager to have a makeover of his own. Joan does the honours, but every time she changes Roy's hairstyle, it plops back to its original appearance. Roy is crestfallen to realise he cannot change the way he looks. What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, Wonder Roy combats Gliterella with his new creation - a soapy water pistol. But, being Wonder Roy, he allows her the creative freedom to add a bit of sparkle to the dreary local library. Back in reality, Roy uses his creativity to fashion a wig for himself, but sadly accepts he is wasting his time. Bill points Roy's cartoon uniqueness and creative flair is something to be proud of. Roy finds solace in his dad's words and celebrates the fact he is a genius when it comes to making over people and in transforming the world around him with creativity(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Roy's New Look.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Roy is intrigued when Joan calls over to style Maura and Becky's hair. Bill suggests Roy should use his natural creative talent to try styling Maura and Becky. Roy gives it a go and is delighted with the results. Maura, Becky, Bill and Joan are all amazed with the work Roy does on changing their looks. Roy is eager to have a makeover of his own. Joan does the honours, but every time she changes Roy's hairstyle, it plops back to its original appearance. Roy is crestfallen to realise he cannot change the way he looks. What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, Wonder Roy combats Gliterella with his new creation - a soapy water pistol. But, being Wonder Roy, he allows her the creative freedom to add a bit of sparkle to the dreary local library. Back in reality, Roy uses his creativity to fashion a wig for himself, but sadly accepts he is wasting his time. Bill points Roy's cartoon uniqueness and creative flair is something to be proud of. Roy finds solace in his dad's words and celebrates the fact he is a genius when it comes to making over people and in transforming the world around him with creativity(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Oh Brother!.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Roy wishes he had a cartoon, little brother who wants to play all the time. Not a big sister who gets mad at him. Nodding off, a dream bubble above his head shows Roy playing with Zip-a little, cartoon brother. When Roy wakes up, he is thrilled to find that Zip has hopped out of his dream and into reality. But things don't quite go according to plan! Roy steps out of his room to find an upturned laundry basket on the landing and clothes everywhere! In the kitchen, Zip wolfs down a cake, and out in the garden he creates a grass whirlwind over Bill's newly mowed lawn. While Roy cleans up Zip's mess with a rake, he tells Tristan all about his cartoon brother who escaped from his dream and is causing havoc. Roy realises that having a cartoon brother who wants to play all the time, might not always be such fun. Roy knows they have to get Zip back to Dreamland and wonders - What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, The Messer is wreaking havoc, until Wonder Roy puts a halt to his shenanigans by bringing in The Messer's mother, wisely working out that everyone gets homesick. Back in reality, Tristan and Roy work together to show Zip what he's missing in Dreamland? endless cakes and endless fun! Zip leaps onto Roy's bed and bounces into the dream bubble. Lesson learned, Roy tidies the bedroom for Becky. He finishes, just in the nick of time, as Becky arrives home with some cake to share with her favourite, little cartoon brother(n)</desc>
