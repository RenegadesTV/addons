    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Cedric Stier, były kolega Meiera ze szkoły, wnosi do szpitala atmosferę rywalizacji. Żona jednego z pacjentów, Silvi, ma wyrazić zgodę na pobranie organów od męża. Takie postawienie sprawy wywołuje otwartą wojnę między Sitierem a Markiem. W konflikt zostaje uwikłana także Gretchen, która ma osobiste powody, by prezentować określone stanowisko w sprawie. Okazuje się, że lekarka nagle zapragnęła stać się chirurgiem z prawdziwego zdarzenia. Co oznacza opanowanie i pełen profesjonalizm. Tuż przed planowaną operacją na wizerunku chłodnej pani doktor pojawiają się rysy..</desc>

Jest zwykłą dziewczyną, która robi karierę medyczną i musi walczyć z porywami serca. Jej osobowość i urok osobisty przyciąga do niej mężczyzn jak magnes. Kolejny raz doktor Haase przeżywa miłosne rozterki. Dla odmiany jednak wszystkie znaki na niebie i ziemi wskazują tylko jednego mężczyznę, na którego widok serce Gretchen bije mocniej. Obiekt jej westchnień jest dla niej niestety nieosiągalny i lekarka powoli oswaja się z porażką. Tymczasem do szpitala trafia była wychowawczyni przedszkolna, pani Schnippel. Kobieta miała nieszczęśliwy wypadek. Okazuje się, że starsza pani zna wstydliwy sekret doktora Meiera jeszcze z czasów dzieciństwa</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

Jest zwykłą dziewczyną, która robi karierę medyczną i musi walczyć z porywami serca. Jej osobowość i urok osobisty przyciąga do niej mężczyzn jak magnes. Kolejny raz doktor Haase przeżywa miłosne rozterki. Dla odmiany jednak wszystkie znaki na niebie i ziemi wskazują tylko jednego mężczyznę, na którego widok serce Gretchen bije mocniej. Obiekt jej westchnień jest dla niej niestety nieosiągalny i lekarka powoli oswaja się z porażką. Tymczasem do szpitala trafia była wychowawczyni przedszkolna, pani Schnippel. Kobieta miała nieszczęśliwy wypadek. Okazuje się, że starsza pani zna wstydliwy sekret doktora Meiera jeszcze z czasów dzieciństwa</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni to świnie</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Mężczyźni są najlepszym lekarstwem</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>
