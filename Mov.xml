    <desc lang="en">Without adopting the romantic and moralistic cliches that have crippled many other films about addiction, Gus Van Sant directs Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, James Le Gros and Heather Graham in one of the most influential films of the late 1980s. Bob (Dillon) is the leader of a small gang of junkies that robs pharmacies and hospitals for prescription drugs. Alas, Bob is now starting to feel the burden of responsibility as he watches over his band of misfits. Van Sant's joyous and exhilarating second feature is notable for its humor and bravery.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Whitney: Can I Be Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Joe and Max</title>
    <desc lang="en">A biopic about legendary boxers Joe Louis and Max Schmeling during the 1930s and '40s. Louis was a beacon of hope in a pre-Civil Rights America, while Schmeling was an icon of the Nazi Party. Outside of the ring, however, the two were good friends, and Schmeling not only spurned the attention and praise of Adolf Hitler, but helped save the lives of several Jews escaping Nazi territory.

    <desc lang="en">For a new intake of Year 7s, secondary school is a vast world that they need to navigate. This series reflects the highs and lows of it all; but ultimately it shows the CBBC viewer worried about going up to big school, that it will all be OK. In Episode One, as well as meeting some of the year 7s we will get to know throughout the series, we meet newcomer Easa, who not only doesn't speak a word of English, but has never been to school before. Social media can sometimes cause big problems in school but it can also transform the way students learn and communicate. In this episode, we discover what can go wrong when mobile phones are used in the wrong way in class - causing a fall out for some of our year 7s - and we also follow the efforts of Leo, who has ADHD and autism. He is on a mission to use social media in a good way, to let the world know what it feels like to be him. It's a big challenge - will he be able to face his fears and present his video to the whole of year 7?</desc>

It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we drop in on three seven-year-olds who are all having a very busy day. In Vietnam, Truc takes pity on her lonely goldfish and goes shopping for some companions. In Russia, Liza and her twin brother, Styopa, take part in a craft class and make a lucky horseshoe for someone special. And in Jordan, Hamza makes a pizza for a picnic with his family in the local park - and scores a goal against his dad. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>
