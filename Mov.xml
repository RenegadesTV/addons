    <desc lang="en">Parker zleca Kim obronę A.J. Fowlera, producenta popularnego reality show "Ta jedyna". Formuła programu zakłada, że kawaler wybiera narzeczoną spośród 30 kandydatek. Wendy Simon odpadła w finale, a teraz oskarża Fowlera o spowodowanie cierpień emocjonalnych. Kim i Parker krok po kroku odkrywają tajemnice tego show i trafiają na trop prawdziwej historii miłosnej, która wydarzyła się na jego planie. Tymczasem Grayson i Jane reprezentują Evana Robbinsa, który został zwolniony z pracy z bardzo oryginalnego powodu. Po śmierci żony zaczął bowiem przeobrażać się w klauna, mimo że nie był zatrudniony w cyrku. Przychodził do pracy w kostiumie i w pełnym makijażu. W ten sposób odreagowywał stratę ukochanej. Jego współpracownicy nie potrafili zrozumieć zachowania kolegi i złożyli przeciwko niemu pozew zbiorowy(n).</desc>

Wkrótce wychodzi na jaw, że dziewczyna jest prześladowana przez koleżankę z klasy, Madison Thomas. Mści się ona na Abby za to, że poinformowała władze szkoły o popełnionym przez nią przestępstwie. Matka prześladowczyni popiera działania córki. W efekcie obie nastolatki i ich adwokaci spotykają się w sądzie. Rozpoczyna się batalia, w wyniku której także Jane pada ofiarą cyberprzemocy.

Dzięki jej wiedzy i pomysłom założył on firmę kosmetyczną, która dziś jest warta fortunę. Teraz Claire chce się rozwieść, ale obawia się, że mąż nie będzie chętny, by oddać jej połowy majątku, mimo że przed laty spisali intercyzę.

Od połowy XX wieku informacje o wydarzeniach i skandalach na dworze Windsorów są jednymi z najbardziej pożądanych tematów przez media w całej Wielkiej Brytanii. Dokument pokazuje w jaki sposób dziennikarze traktują przedstawicieli rodziny oraz w jaki sposób odnosi się ona do mediów. Przypomina też ważne wydarzenia, które nie pozostały bez wpływu na te relacje, jak choćby śmierć księżnej Diany lub film produkcji BBC z 1969 roku, który pokazał życie rodziny od kuchni(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Parker zleca Kim obronę A.J. Fowlera, producenta popularnego reality show "Ta jedyna". Formuła programu zakłada, że kawaler wybiera narzeczoną spośród 30 kandydatek. Wendy Simon odpadła w finale, a teraz oskarża Fowlera o spowodowanie cierpień emocjonalnych. Kim i Parker krok po kroku odkrywają tajemnice tego show i trafiają na trop prawdziwej historii miłosnej, która wydarzyła się na jego planie. Tymczasem Grayson i Jane reprezentują Evana Robbinsa, który został zwolniony z pracy z bardzo oryginalnego powodu. Po śmierci żony zaczął bowiem przeobrażać się w klauna, mimo że nie był zatrudniony w cyrku. Przychodził do pracy w kostiumie i w pełnym makijażu. W ten sposób odreagowywał stratę ukochanej. Jego współpracownicy nie potrafili zrozumieć zachowania kolegi i złożyli przeciwko niemu pozew zbiorowy(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Zdesperowana matka prosi Jane o pomoc. Odkryła bowiem, że ktoś umieścił w internecie nagie zdjęcia jej córki Abby. Wkrótce wychodzi na jaw, że dziewczyna jest prześladowana przez koleżankę z klasy, Madison Thomas. Mści się ona na Abby za to, że poinformowała władze szkoły o popełnionym przez nią przestępstwie. Matka prześladowczyni popiera działania córki. W efekcie obie nastolatki i ich adwokaci spotykają się w sądzie. Rozpoczyna się batalia, w wyniku której także Jane pada ofiarą cyberprzemocy. Tymczasem w kancelarii zjawia się jej współwłaścicielka Claire Harrison. Potrzebuje ona pomocy przy rozwodzie. Kilka lat temu prawniczka wyszła za mąż za surfera Simona Bella. Dzięki jej wiedzy i pomysłom założył on firmę kosmetyczną, która dziś jest warta fortunę. Teraz Claire chce się rozwieść, ale obawia się, że mąż nie będzie chętny, by oddać jej połowy majątku, mimo że przed laty spisali intercyzę. Problem w tym, że zrobili to na kawiarnianej serwetce..(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Wzajemne relacje członków brytyjskiej rodziny królewskiej i dziennikarzy należą do bardzo skomplikowanych. Od połowy XX wieku informacje o wydarzeniach i skandalach na dworze Windsorów są jednymi z najbardziej pożądanych tematów przez media w całej Wielkiej Brytanii. Dokument pokazuje w jaki sposób dziennikarze traktują przedstawicieli rodziny oraz w jaki sposób odnosi się ona do mediów. Przypomina też ważne wydarzenia, które nie pozostały bez wpływu na te relacje, jak choćby śmierć księżnej Diany lub film produkcji BBC z 1969 roku, który pokazał życie rodziny od kuchni(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley(n).</desc>
