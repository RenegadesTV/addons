    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Twórcy programu odwiedzają miejsca, w których odbywają się najciekawsze wakacyjne wydarzenia. Zawitają zarówno do największych polskich miast, jak i mniejszych ośrodków. Pojawią się na imprezach plenerowych, w klubach, na plażach, basenach, aquaparkach czy zawodach sportowych. Prowadzący zapytają napotkane tam osoby o to, jak spędzają lato i gdzie wypoczywają. Nie zabraknie rozmów z gwiazdami i gości specjalnych.</desc>

It's only temporary, until they find a bigger place, but the resulting chaos drives Millie, Lauren, Fran and Jake round to Mum's. And Millie has an ulterior motive: getting Craig to look after the hyper Jake as revenge for his annoying behaviour. She thinks it'll teach him to be a better brother - but Jake thinks Craig is pretty cool as he is, and starts imitating his teenage ways. Back in the confusion of the crowded flat, Dad's new website is bringing in lots of work, but his Post-It based filing system has a major weakness: gusts of wind.</desc>

All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben.(n)</desc>
