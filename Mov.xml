Grayson szybko ulega urokowi atrakcyjnej celebrytki. Nie ułatwia mu to koncentracji nad sprawą. Tymczasem Kim i Preston znów przychodzą razem do pracy, co wywołuje lawinę plotek i spekulacji. Oboje zajmują się sprawą właścicielki hotelu, któremu grozi bankructwo. Wszystko przez niepochlebne opinie o jej pensjonacie, które pojawiają się ostatnio w internetowym przewodniku turystycznym. Kobieta jest przekonana, że jego autorzy mszczą się w ten sposób za to, że zrezygnowała z zamieszczenia reklamy na ich stronie. Właścicielka żąda finansowego zadośćuczynienia za zniesławienie. Rozpoczyna się proces, podczas którego na jaw wychodzi wiele interesujących faktów..(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Klientką Jane zostaje Ellie Tannen, jedna z najważniejszych osób w świecie mody. Celebrytka chce wstrzymać publikację książki, którą napisała jej była asystentka, Dawn Lucas. Tannen przedstawiona jest w niej w fatalnym świetle. Bingum wie, że nie może zapobiec wydaniu książki, gdyż oznaczałoby to złamanie zasady wolności słowa. Jedynym wyjściem wydaje się wytoczenie procesu, podczas którego Tannen udowodni, że wszystko co napisała Lucas to bzdury. Wkrótce Jane wpada na genialny pomysł. Podczas rozprawy jej klienta wycofuje się jednak ze stawianych Lucas zarzutów, przez co ośmiesza swoją prawniczkę. Bingum postanawia dowiedzieć się, co się za tym kryje. Kim i Grayson reprezentują przed sądem transseksualistkę Allison Webb. Jeszcze jako mężczyzna zawarła ona związek małżeński. Żona Webb zmarła, nie pozostawiając testamentu. Teraz jej rodzice domagają się od Allison zwrotu rzeczy należących do córki. Nie mogą też zaakceptować faktu, że ich dziecko było związane z transseksualną osobą(n).(n)</desc>

Grayson szybko ulega urokowi atrakcyjnej celebrytki. Nie ułatwia mu to koncentracji nad sprawą. Tymczasem Kim i Preston znów przychodzą razem do pracy, co wywołuje lawinę plotek i spekulacji. Oboje zajmują się sprawą właścicielki hotelu, któremu grozi bankructwo. Wszystko przez niepochlebne opinie o jej pensjonacie, które pojawiają się ostatnio w internetowym przewodniku turystycznym. Kobieta jest przekonana, że jego autorzy mszczą się w ten sposób za to, że zrezygnowała z zamieszczenia reklamy na ich stronie. Właścicielka żąda finansowego zadośćuczynienia za zniesławienie. Rozpoczyna się proces, podczas którego na jaw wychodzi wiele interesujących faktów..(n).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Klientką Jane zostaje Ellie Tannen, jedna z najważniejszych osób w świecie mody. Celebrytka chce wstrzymać publikację książki, którą napisała jej była asystentka, Dawn Lucas. Tannen przedstawiona jest w niej w fatalnym świetle. Bingum wie, że nie może zapobiec wydaniu książki, gdyż oznaczałoby to złamanie zasady wolności słowa. Jedynym wyjściem wydaje się wytoczenie procesu, podczas którego Tannen udowodni, że wszystko co napisała Lucas to bzdury. Wkrótce Jane wpada na genialny pomysł. Podczas rozprawy jej klienta wycofuje się jednak ze stawianych Lucas zarzutów, przez co ośmiesza swoją prawniczkę. Bingum postanawia dowiedzieć się, co się za tym kryje. Kim i Grayson reprezentują przed sądem transseksualistkę Allison Webb. Jeszcze jako mężczyzna zawarła ona związek małżeński. Żona Webb zmarła, nie pozostawiając testamentu. Teraz jej rodzice domagają się od Allison zwrotu rzeczy należących do córki. Nie mogą też zaakceptować faktu, że ich dziecko było związane z transseksualną osobą(n).(n)</desc>

To Nick and Eve's horror, Katherine reveals her new range of childbots, which have been placed with local families. To prevent Katherine restoring KT to factory settings, Eve smuggles her out of Calimov and back to the Clarke house. But with Will and Lily insisting KT is returned to Calimov, Eve and her sister are forced to take matters into their own hands. The situation escalates when Katherine's childbots start to malfunction and it is KT who comes under suspicion, admitting she has no wish to pass as human. In order to make Eve prove she loves her sister as she is, KT wants Eve to reveal her own robot identity to the world. Trapped inside the house by the childbots, and with police and reporters gathering outside, the gang's worst fears have been realised. With Eve about to admit her secret to the world on live TV, can Will's nanobots save the day?(n).(n)</desc>
