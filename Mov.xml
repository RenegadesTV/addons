    <desc lang="en">Community on Solid Ground is a youth centre in Whalley Range. Before its current management took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common. That has dropped by 73 per cent since Community on Solid Ground came along, the kids can hang out, play sports and have a place to go that means they aren't hanging around the streets. Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics. Presented by Mark Wright and Lauren Layfield.</desc>

Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">There is an amazing seahorse merry-go-round on the beach, and everyone is having lots of fun going round and round - except Bevel. When he runs away from the ride, Bob finds him, only for Bevel to admit he's nervous about going in circles. Everyone joins in to help him overcome his fear and soon he's sitting on his seahorse, Blue Yah, excited about his first turn on a merry-go-round. But now the key that winds it up has broken, so Bitz needs to work out how to get it started using wind power.</desc>
