    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Cedric Stier, były kolega Meiera ze szkoły, wnosi do szpitala atmosferę rywalizacji. Żona jednego z pacjentów, Silvi, ma wyrazić zgodę na pobranie organów od męża. Takie postawienie sprawy wywołuje otwartą wojnę między Sitierem a Markiem. W konflikt zostaje uwikłana także Gretchen, która ma osobiste powody, by prezentować określone stanowisko w sprawie. Okazuje się, że lekarka nagle zapragnęła stać się chirurgiem z prawdziwego zdarzenia. Co oznacza opanowanie i pełen profesjonalizm.

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 13)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">W przeciwieństwie do Heidi Klum Gretchen nie przepada za rywalizacją. Ma pecha, gdyż doktor Knechtlsdorfer, z którym ubiega się o posadę starszego asystenta, wprost to uwielbia. Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia. W jej życiu pojawia się bogacz, który ma ochotę na bliższą znajomość. Będzie się działo!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Cedric Stier, były kolega Meiera ze szkoły, wnosi do szpitala atmosferę rywalizacji. Żona jednego z pacjentów, Silvi, ma wyrazić zgodę na pobranie organów od męża. Takie postawienie sprawy wywołuje otwartą wojnę między Sitierem a Markiem. W konflikt zostaje uwikłana także Gretchen, która ma osobiste powody, by prezentować określone stanowisko w sprawie.

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 13)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">W przeciwieństwie do Heidi Klum Gretchen nie przepada za rywalizacją. Ma pecha, gdyż doktor Knechtlsdorfer, z którym ubiega się o posadę starszego asystenta, wprost to uwielbia. Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia. W jej życiu pojawia się bogacz, który ma ochotę na bliższą znajomość. Będzie się działo!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Do szpitala trafia matka Meiera. Cierpi na wrzody żołądka. Gretchen przenosi się w świat fantazji. Snuje rozważania na temat powieści 'Dr. Rogelt' i swojej roli w przedstawionej tam historii miłosnej(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Salford Curse.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Jas decides to follow in her dad's footsteps and try out for the junior hockey team. Mr Salford was a legendary hockey goalie in his time at the school. When the try-outs are cancelled due to the coach not being available, Mr Salford steps in and offers his services as coach. Mrs Griggs is horrified - she could do without the chaos he inevitably brings with him - but he won't take no for an answer. Jas and her father are really superstitious and when things start going wrong Jas thinks she's jinxed, and then that she's passed on the jinx to her dad. When she's not picked as goalie for the team Jas is actually relieved - it must mean she's still jinxed and hasn't passed on the jinx to her dad. Eventually Jas does need to play in goal, but when she saves a crucial penalty she and her dad are delighted to realise they are not jinxed after all, just accident-prone! Meanwhile, Martha &amp; Ollie get paranoid that Cassie &amp; Maxwell are usurping them. They've taken over their favourite nook in the library and when they turn up to do their regular security check on Mrs Rennison's computer Cassie and Maxwell have already been there and done it. They decide they've got to get their own back and they sabotage a fizzy drinks maker Cassie and Maxwell have created to provide refreshments at the hockey match. They turn up the CO2 dial and everyone gets very burpy! Lily is feeling abandoned by her friends - they all seem too busy to hang out with her. Matt advises her that a big gesture could do the trick. When she unfurls a giant banner during the hockey match declaring her admiration for her friends it's really embarrassing. It does prompt Martha and Ollie to do the right thing, though, and confess to Cassie and Maxwell that they sabotaged their fizzy drinks machine and does inspire Jas to save that crucial penalty</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Salford Curse.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Jas decides to follow in her dad's footsteps and try out for the junior hockey team. Mr Salford was a legendary hockey goalie in his time at the school. When the try-outs are cancelled due to the coach not being available, Mr Salford steps in and offers his services as coach. Mrs Griggs is horrified - she could do without the chaos he inevitably brings with him - but he won't take no for an answer. Jas and her father are really superstitious and when things start going wrong Jas thinks she's jinxed, and then that she's passed on the jinx to her dad. When she's not picked as goalie for the team Jas is actually relieved - it must mean she's still jinxed and hasn't passed on the jinx to her dad. Eventually Jas does need to play in goal, but when she saves a crucial penalty she and her dad are delighted to realise they are not jinxed after all, just accident-prone! Meanwhile, Martha &amp; Ollie get paranoid that Cassie &amp; Maxwell are usurping them. They've taken over their favourite nook in the library and when they turn up to do their regular security check on Mrs Rennison's computer Cassie and Maxwell have already been there and done it. They decide they've got to get their own back and they sabotage a fizzy drinks maker Cassie and Maxwell have created to provide refreshments at the hockey match. They turn up the CO2 dial and everyone gets very burpy! Lily is feeling abandoned by her friends - they all seem too busy to hang out with her. Matt advises her that a big gesture could do the trick. When she unfurls a giant banner during the hockey match declaring her admiration for her friends it's really embarrassing. It does prompt Martha and Ollie to do the right thing, though, and confess to Cassie and Maxwell that they sabotaged their fizzy drinks machine and does inspire Jas to save that crucial penalty</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Hamza,Truc and Anushka: Truc has a little sleep - at school.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal</desc>
