    <desc lang="en">An already bad day for Driver is not getting any better. He makes a big haul of millions that would give him a nice summer vacation on easy street, but it goes south - literally. During a high-speed car chase with the US Border Patrol and a bleeding body in his back seat, Driver flips his car smashing through the border wall, tumbling violently, coming to a stop in Mexico. Apprehended by the Mexican authorities, he is sent to a hard-core prison where he enters the strange and dangerous world of "El Pueblito". Starring Mel Gibson.</desc>

In Russia, seven-year-old Liza picks blueberries with her grandma - and helps turn them into delicious pancakes. In Ghana, Tyra, who's five, goes to the market with her mum and learns how to do the shopping. And in Jordan, Hamza, who's eight, has a day out in town with his dad, and buys a lovely present for his baby sister, Mimi. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.</desc>
