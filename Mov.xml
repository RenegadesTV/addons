    <desc lang="pl">W głowie 38-letniej Olgi z Poznania coraz szybciej rozwija się guz, w wyniku czego przestała słyszeć na jedno ucho. Ma też lekką asymetrię lewej części twarzy i problemy ze wzrokiem. Wizja powikłań sprawiła, że uciekała przed decyzją o operacji przez kilka lat. Próbowała leczyć się przy pomocy medycyny naturalnej, a nawet jogi. Od pewnego czasu guz zaczął jednak rosnąć w zastraszającym tempie, co zmusiło Olgę do podjęcia decyzji o leczeniu. Uwierzyła, że dr Głowacki ze Szpitala Zachodniego w Grodzisku Mazowieckim może jej pomóc. Operacja, której podjął się specjalista jest bardzo ryzykowna i skomplikowana</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Helen Wakefield publicznie policzkuje Jacka Bryanta, trenera szkolnej drużyny koszykówki. Mężczyzna doznaje poważnej kontuzji szyi i domaga się odszkodowania za utratę zdrowia. Helen uderzyła szkoleniowca, gdyż dyskryminował jej córkę, nie pozwalając ośmiolatce grać w pierwszym składzie zespołu. Zamiast niej wystawiał swoje dziecko. Sprawa wydaje się przesądzona, gdyż wina Helen jest bezsprzeczna. Jane postanawia jednak wykorzystać przed sądem pewne informacje o Bryancie, które zdobyła jeszcze jako Deb. Wkrótce Teri wzywa Bingum na posterunek policji. Razem z kuzynem Edwardem została bowiem aresztowana za zakłócanie porządku publicznego. Sprawa jest jednak poważniejsza, gdyż Edwardowi grozi deportacja do Korei Płd. Mężczyzna jest w szoku, gdyż całe życie spędził w USA. Jedyną szansą, by go ocalić jest wyjawienie mu rodzinnej tajemnicy związanej z jego urodzeniem. Tony dostaje awans. W związku z tym musi przeprowadzić się do Waszyngtonu. Bingum zastanawia się, czy wyjechać razem z nim</desc>

Sędzia decydująca w jej sprawie okazuje się wyjątkowo wyrozumiała i Elaine wychodzi na wolność. Jane, która wie niewiele o swojej przeszłości, dopiero teraz odkrywa, że jej matka ma bogatą policyjną kartotekę. Zaczyna zastanawiać się, czy zawsze była ona taką ekscentryczką, czy może powodem jej dziwnego zachowania jest zupełnie co innego. By rozwiązać tę zagadkę Jane składa wizytę swojemu ojcu Henry'emu. Próbując pomóc matce, Bingum odkrywa rodzinny sekret. Tymczasem Grayson zostaje obrońcą nauczycielki Joan Finer. Powierzyła ona swoje oszczędności finansiście Maksowi Adamsowi, który okazał się oszustem. Joan straciła dorobek całego życia. Odzyskać pieniądze będzie trudno, gdyż oficjalnie Adams także wszystko stracił. Na dodatek jest poważnie chory i wkrótce umrze. Joan zaczyna mieć obiekcje moralne, czy składać pozew przeciwko Adamsowi. W przeciwieństwie do Graysona..</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Ostatnia kolejka</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Pete O'Donnell (Christopher Lloyd) prowadzi irlandzki pub na Long Island. Niestety w lokalu brakuje gości i interes nie przynosi zysków, przez co mężczyzna popada w coraz większe długi. Zdesperowany dzwoni do swoich bratanków, Danny'ego (Travis Van Winkle) i Phila (Ryan Hansen), i prosi ich o pomoc. Obaj kuzyni mają mnóstwo pomysłów na rozkręcenie biznesu. Okaże się, czy uda im się wyciągnąć wuja z tarapatów i uratować lokal przed zamknięciem. Szalona komedia o przygodach zwariowanych młodzieńców, którzy są zdeterminowani, by uratować rodzinny biznes i ulubionego wuja. W filmie Grega Garthe'a wystąpili: Travis Van Winkle ("Transformers", "Poznaj moich Spartan"), Ryan Hansen (serial "Weronika Mars", "Wolna chata"), Tara Reid ("Big Lebowski", cykl "American Pie") oraz trzykrotny laureat Emmy Christopher Lloyd ("Lot nad kukułczym gniazdem", cykl "Powrót do przyszłości")</desc>

Grayson szybko ulega urokowi atrakcyjnej celebrytki. Nie ułatwia mu to koncentracji nad sprawą. Tymczasem Kim i Preston znów przychodzą razem do pracy, co wywołuje lawinę plotek i spekulacji. Oboje zajmują się sprawą właścicielki hotelu, któremu grozi bankructwo. Wszystko przez niepochlebne opinie o jej pensjonacie, które pojawiają się ostatnio w internetowym przewodniku turystycznym. Kobieta jest przekonana, że jego autorzy mszczą się w ten sposób za to, że zrezygnowała z zamieszczenia reklamy na ich stronie. Właścicielka żąda finansowego zadośćuczynienia za zniesławienie. Rozpoczyna się proces, podczas którego na jaw wychodzi wiele interesujących faktów..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">W głowie 38-letniej Olgi z Poznania coraz szybciej rozwija się guz, w wyniku czego przestała słyszeć na jedno ucho. Ma też lekką asymetrię lewej części twarzy i problemy ze wzrokiem. Wizja powikłań sprawiła, że uciekała przed decyzją o operacji przez kilka lat. Próbowała leczyć się przy pomocy medycyny naturalnej, a nawet jogi. Od pewnego czasu guz zaczął jednak rosnąć w zastraszającym tempie, co zmusiło Olgę do podjęcia decyzji o leczeniu. Uwierzyła, że dr Głowacki ze Szpitala Zachodniego w Grodzisku Mazowieckim może jej pomóc. Operacja, której podjął się specjalista jest bardzo ryzykowna i skomplikowana</desc>

Helen uderzyła szkoleniowca, gdyż dyskryminował jej córkę, nie pozwalając ośmiolatce grać w pierwszym składzie zespołu. Zamiast niej wystawiał swoje dziecko. Sprawa wydaje się przesądzona, gdyż wina Helen jest bezsprzeczna. Jane postanawia jednak wykorzystać przed sądem pewne informacje o Bryancie, które zdobyła jeszcze jako Deb. Wkrótce Teri wzywa Bingum na posterunek policji. Razem z kuzynem Edwardem została bowiem aresztowana za zakłócanie porządku publicznego. Sprawa jest jednak poważniejsza, gdyż Edwardowi grozi deportacja do Korei Płd. Mężczyzna jest w szoku, gdyż całe życie spędził w USA. Jedyną szansą, by go ocalić jest wyjawienie mu rodzinnej tajemnicy związanej z jego urodzeniem. Tony dostaje awans. W związku z tym musi przeprowadzić się do Waszyngtonu. Bingum zastanawia się, czy wyjechać razem z nim</desc>

Po roku Agnieszka ponownie pojawia się na tym samym oddziale, na którym uratowano jej życie. Laryngolodzy mają udrożnić jej nos, który został połamany w czasie zderzenia. Dzięki zabiegowi będzie mogła normalnie oddychać i odzyska dawny wygląd</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Elaine, matka Jane, zostaje aresztowana pod zarzutem napaści na stróżów prawa i obnażania się w miejscu publicznym. Sędzia decydująca w jej sprawie okazuje się wyjątkowo wyrozumiała i Elaine wychodzi na wolność. Jane, która wie niewiele o swojej przeszłości, dopiero teraz odkrywa, że jej matka ma bogatą policyjną kartotekę. Zaczyna zastanawiać się, czy zawsze była ona taką ekscentryczką, czy może powodem jej dziwnego zachowania jest zupełnie co innego. By rozwiązać tę zagadkę Jane składa wizytę swojemu ojcu Henry'emu. Próbując pomóc matce, Bingum odkrywa rodzinny sekret. Tymczasem Grayson zostaje obrońcą nauczycielki Joan Finer. Powierzyła ona swoje oszczędności finansiście Maksowi Adamsowi, który okazał się oszustem. Joan straciła dorobek całego życia. Odzyskać pieniądze będzie trudno, gdyż oficjalnie Adams także wszystko stracił. Na dodatek jest poważnie chory i wkrótce umrze. Joan zaczyna mieć obiekcje moralne, czy składać pozew przeciwko Adamsowi. W przeciwieństwie do Graysona..</desc>

Niestety w lokalu brakuje gości i interes nie przynosi zysków, przez co mężczyzna popada w coraz większe długi.

    <desc lang="pl">Znajdujący się na zwolnieniu warunkowym mafijny boss Bellavance (Ray Wise) ma mało czasu, by odzyskać skradzione mu 500 tysięcy dolarów. Wynajmuje czwórkę płatnych morderców. Nakazuje im brutalnie sterroryzować rodziny tych, którzy mogli być zamieszani w kradzież. Mafijni wysłannicy wdzierają się do domu Billa (Boyd Kestner), którego nagłe wzbogacenie się wydaje się bardzo podejrzane. Nie wiedzą, że czeka ich tam starcie z jego cierpiącym na zaburzenia umysłowe nastoletnim synem Owenem (Ryan Hartwig). Ponury chłopak jest agresywny, podstępny i niezwykle inteligentny. Postanawia dać gangsterom krwawą nauczkę(n)</desc>
