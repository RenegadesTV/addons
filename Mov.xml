    <title lang="en">Bloody Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tom is a hard-working manager at a big box super store. He started in the stock room, always imagining himself at the helm. Now poised for a big promotion, he gets the news he always feared: no college degree means no promotion. In the face of this new reality, and lamenting the time he devoted to work over family, Tom and his wife Carol decide to change course and start a family business. They pack up their kids and move to a small town to take over a run-down garage bequeathed to them by Tom's estranged father.</desc>

Those featured include 39-year-old Georgina, who was once a frumpy mum but has now followed daughter Kayla by becoming the image of a Barbie doll, complete with fake boobs and lips. Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?</desc>
