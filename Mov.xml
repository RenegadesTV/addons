    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 8)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

Lekarka potrzebuje męskiego ramienia, by się wypłakać, lecz niestety nie ma co liczyć na ginekologa Kaana. Może mieć tylko nadzieję, że doktor odejdzie dla niej od żony. Jakby kłopotów było mało przyjaciółka Haase zapada na raka i nie zgadza się na leczenie. W życiu lekarki pojawia się też zamożny Alexis von Buren, który jest nią wyraźnie zainteresowany. Podczas oglądania paczka chusteczek i pudełko czekoladek są wskazane, gdyż zapowiada się naprawdę wzruszający odcinek</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 10)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Meier łamie serce Gretchen, gdyż nie rezygnuje ze ślubu z pielęgniarką Gabi. Lekarka potrzebuje męskiego ramienia, by się wypłakać, lecz niestety nie ma co liczyć na ginekologa Kaana. Może mieć tylko nadzieję, że doktor odejdzie dla niej od żony. Jakby kłopotów było mało przyjaciółka Haase zapada na raka i nie zgadza się na leczenie. W życiu lekarki pojawia się też zamożny Alexis von Buren, który jest nią wyraźnie zainteresowany. Podczas oglądania paczka chusteczek i pudełko czekoladek są wskazane, gdyż zapowiada się naprawdę wzruszający odcinek</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki. Sukces nie zagłusza w niej chęci poznania odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy seks pod prysznicem jest wygodny. Chciałaby rozwiać swoje wątpliwości w tej kwestii(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">W przeciwieństwie do Heidi Klum Gretchen nie przepada za rywalizacją. Ma pecha, gdyż doktor Knechtlsdorfer, z którym ubiega się o posadę starszego asystenta, wprost to uwielbia. Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia. W jej życiu pojawia się bogacz, który ma ochotę na bliższą znajomość. Będzie się działo!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 8)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Meier łamie serce Gretchen, gdyż nie rezygnuje ze ślubu z pielęgniarką Gabi. Lekarka potrzebuje męskiego ramienia, by się wypłakać, lecz niestety nie ma co liczyć na ginekologa Kaana. Może mieć tylko nadzieję, że doktor odejdzie dla niej od żony. Jakby kłopotów było mało przyjaciółka Haase zapada na raka i nie zgadza się na leczenie. W życiu lekarki pojawia się też zamożny Alexis von Buren, który jest nią wyraźnie zainteresowany. Podczas oglądania paczka chusteczek i pudełko czekoladek są wskazane, gdyż zapowiada się naprawdę wzruszający odcinek</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki. Sukces nie zagłusza w niej chęci poznania odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy seks pod prysznicem jest wygodny. Chciałaby rozwiać swoje wątpliwości w tej kwestii(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">W przeciwieństwie do Heidi Klum Gretchen nie przepada za rywalizacją. Ma pecha, gdyż doktor Knechtlsdorfer, z którym ubiega się o posadę starszego asystenta, wprost to uwielbia. Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia. W jej życiu pojawia się bogacz, który ma ochotę na bliższą znajomość. Będzie się działo!(n)</desc>
