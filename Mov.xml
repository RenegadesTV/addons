    <title lang="en">The Banger Sisters</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the late '60s, the self-proclaimed belles of the rock 'n' roll ball, rocked the worlds of every music legend whose pants they could take off -- and they have the pictures to prove it. But it's been more than two decades since the Banger Sisters earned their nickname -- or even laid eyes on each other. Their reunion is the collision of two women's worlds; one who's living in the past, and one who's hiding from it. Together they learn to live in the moment.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sean Boswell always feels like an outsider, but he defines himself through his victories as a street racer. His hobby makes him unpopular with the authorities, so he goes to live with his father in Japan. Once there and even more alienated, he learns about an exciting, but dangerous, new style of the sport. The stakes are high when Sean takes on the local champion and falls for the man's girlfriend.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Uroczysta gala wręczenia nagród w piętnastej edycji popularnego plebiscytu. W Szczecinie o wyróżnienia w siedmiu kategoriach, m.in. dla najlepszego hitu, radiowego debiutu, zespołu, artystki i artysty, rywalizować będą znani artyści. Na scenie w Azoty Arenie pojawią się polscy wokaliści, których utwory na przełomie 2015 i 2016 roku biły rekordy popularności, m.in. Margaret, Sylwia Grzeszczak, Ewelina Lisowska, Grzegorz Hyży, C-BooL, Sound'n'Grace oraz Video. Po raz pierwszy przed szczecińską widownią zaśpiewają debiutanci: Monika Lewczuk, Antek Smykiewicz i Szymon Chodyniecki. Gwiazdą wieczoru będzie norweski producent muzyczny Alan Walker, który wykona dwa przeboje: "Faded" oraz "Sing Me To Sleep". Towarzyszyć mu będzie piosenkarka Iselin Solheim.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Uroczysta gala wręczenia nagród w piętnastej edycji popularnego plebiscytu. W Szczecinie o wyróżnienia w siedmiu kategoriach, m.in. dla najlepszego hitu, radiowego debiutu, zespołu, artystki i artysty, rywalizować będą znani artyści. Na scenie w Azoty Arenie pojawią się polscy wokaliści, których utwory na przełomie 2015 i 2016 roku biły rekordy popularności, m.in. Margaret, Sylwia Grzeszczak, Ewelina Lisowska, Grzegorz Hyży, C-BooL, Sound'n'Grace oraz Video. Po raz pierwszy przed szczecińską widownią zaśpiewają debiutanci: Monika Lewczuk, Antek Smykiewicz i Szymon Chodyniecki. Gwiazdą wieczoru będzie norweski producent muzyczny Alan Walker, który wykona dwa przeboje: "Faded" oraz "Sing Me To Sleep". Towarzyszyć mu będzie piosenkarka Iselin Solheim.</desc>
