    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. W tym odcinku Rachel odkrywa bliskie związki Londynu ze Wschodem, który doskonale odzwierciedla małżeństwo jej mamy rodowitej Austriaczki i pochodzącego z Melanezji taty. Razem z przyjaciółmi zamawia danie na wynos chińskie Dim Sum. Następnie we wschodnim Londynie Rachel pod okiem miejscowego szefa kuchni zgłębia tajniki egzotycznych dań, by później już we własnej kuchni przygotować orientalnego kurczaka z malezyjską sałatką i bułeczkami na parze</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gdy Joanna miała 26 lat, zdiagnozowano u niej astmę. Przez kolejne 15 lat leczenia zażywała sterydy, w wyniku czego przytyła 145 kilogramów. Dodatkowo przeszła kilka poważnych zabiegów - operację pękniętego płuca, wszczepienie rozrusznika serca i jego usunięcie. Po ostatniej operacji Joanna schudła 40 kilogramów. Niestety, pozostały jej fałdy skóry, które uniemożliwiają normalne funkcjonowanie. Nadmiar ciała naciska na przeponę i utrudnia oddychanie. Jej skóra jest bardzo cienka i boleśnie pęka przy delikatnym pociągnięciu. Joanna marzy o pozbyciu się nadmiaru skóry i przepukliny. Do tej pory lekarze odmawiali pomocy. W końcu udaje się znaleźć specjalistę, który podejmuje się wyzwania</desc>

Nagle uroczystość przerywa Hope Prentiss, która zarzuca Bingum, że zniszczyła jej małżeństwo, romansując z jej mężem. Oskarżenia są poważne, ale Jane jest przekonana, że to nieporozumienie. Co prawda nie pamięta nic ze swojej przeszłości, ale nie wierzy, by mogła związać się z żonatym mężczyzną. Hope pokazuje jednak zdjęcia jednoznacznie dowodzące, że Bingum spotykała się z Toddem Prentissem w motelu. Co więcej, ten policjant zniknął bez śladu osiem miesięcy temu, wkrótce po rzekomej randce z Jane. By rozwiązać tę zagadkę, Bingum musi lepiej poznaą swoją przeszłość. Tymczasem Grayson staje do sądowej batalii z byłym narzeczonym swojej obecnej dziewczyny Vanessy, Willem Caseyem. Musi przekonać go, by nie przenosił on fabryki do Meksyku, wskutek czego wszyscy amerykańscy pracownicy jego firmy stracą pracę. Dla Kenta to bardzo ważna sprawa, także ze względów osobistych</desc>

Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia.

    <desc lang="pl">Parker zleca Kim obronę A.J. Fowlera, producenta popularnego reality show "Ta jedyna". Formuła programu zakłada, że kawaler wybiera narzeczoną spośród 30 kandydatek. Wendy Simon odpadła w finale, a teraz oskarża Fowlera o spowodowanie cierpień emocjonalnych. Kim i Parker krok po kroku odkrywają tajemnice tego show i trafiają na trop prawdziwej historii miłosnej, która wydarzyła się na jego planie. Tymczasem Grayson i Jane reprezentują Evana Robbinsa, który został zwolniony z pracy z bardzo oryginalnego powodu. Po śmierci żony zaczął bowiem przeobrażać się w klauna, mimo że nie był zatrudniony w cyrku. Przychodził do pracy w kostiumie i w pełnym makijażu. W ten sposób odreagowywał stratę ukochanej. Jego współpracownicy nie potrafili zrozumieć zachowania kolegi i złożyli przeciwko niemu pozew zbiorowy</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">W głowie rozczarowanego życiem Malcolma (James Frecheville) rodzi się zbrodniczy plan. Mężczyzna udaje się do centrum handlowego z torbą wypełnioną bronią i ładunkami wybuchowymi. Wcześniej strzela do matki i podpala przyczepę, w której dotychczas mieszkał. Na drodze desperata stają przypadkowe osoby. Wśród nich są znudzona gospodyni domowa Donna (Gina Gershon), nienawidzący swojej pracy sprzedawca Barry (Peter Stormare), owdowiały ochroniarz Michael (Gbenga Akinnagbe) i uzależniony od seksu biznesmen Danny (Vincent D'Onofrio). Świadkiem dramatycznych zdarzeń jest również nieszczęśliwie zakochany Jeff (Cameron Monaghan), który próbuje zagłuszyć smutek narkotykami. Scenariusz produkcji powstał w oparciu o powieści znanego amerykańskiego pisarza i aktora Erica Bogosiana</desc>

Wkrótce wychodzi na jaw, że dziewczyna jest prześladowana przez koleżankę z klasy, Madison Thomas. Mści się ona na Abby za to, że poinformowała władze szkoły o popełnionym przez nią przestępstwie. Matka prześladowczyni popiera działania córki. W efekcie obie nastolatki i ich adwokaci spotykają się w sądzie. Rozpoczyna się batalia, w wyniku której także Jane pada ofiarą cyberprzemocy. Tymczasem w kancelarii zjawia się jej współwłaścicielka Claire Harrison. Potrzebuje ona pomocy przy rozwodzie. Kilka lat temu prawniczka wyszła za mąż za surfera Simona Bella. Dzięki jej wiedzy i pomysłom założył on firmę kosmetyczną, która dziś jest warta fortunę. Teraz Claire chce się rozwieść, ale obawia się, że mąż nie będzie chętny, by oddać jej połowy majątku, mimo że przed laty spisali intercyzę.

    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. W tym odcinku Rachel odkrywa bliskie związki Londynu ze Wschodem, który doskonale odzwierciedla małżeństwo jej mamy rodowitej Austriaczki i pochodzącego z Melanezji taty. Razem z przyjaciółmi zamawia danie na wynos chińskie Dim Sum. Następnie we wschodnim Londynie Rachel pod okiem miejscowego szefa kuchni zgłębia tajniki egzotycznych dań, by później już we własnej kuchni przygotować orientalnego kurczaka z malezyjską sałatką i bułeczkami na parze</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gdy Joanna miała 26 lat, zdiagnozowano u niej astmę. Przez kolejne 15 lat leczenia zażywała sterydy, w wyniku czego przytyła 145 kilogramów. Dodatkowo przeszła kilka poważnych zabiegów - operację pękniętego płuca, wszczepienie rozrusznika serca i jego usunięcie. Po ostatniej operacji Joanna schudła 40 kilogramów. Niestety, pozostały jej fałdy skóry, które uniemożliwiają normalne funkcjonowanie. Nadmiar ciała naciska na przeponę i utrudnia oddychanie. Jej skóra jest bardzo cienka i boleśnie pęka przy delikatnym pociągnięciu. Joanna marzy o pozbyciu się nadmiaru skóry i przepukliny. Do tej pory lekarze odmawiali pomocy. W końcu udaje się znaleźć specjalistę, który podejmuje się wyzwania</desc>

Nagle uroczystość przerywa Hope Prentiss, która zarzuca Bingum, że zniszczyła jej małżeństwo, romansując z jej mężem. Oskarżenia są poważne, ale Jane jest przekonana, że to nieporozumienie. Co prawda nie pamięta nic ze swojej przeszłości, ale nie wierzy, by mogła związać się z żonatym mężczyzną. Hope pokazuje jednak zdjęcia jednoznacznie dowodzące, że Bingum spotykała się z Toddem Prentissem w motelu. Co więcej, ten policjant zniknął bez śladu osiem miesięcy temu, wkrótce po rzekomej randce z Jane. By rozwiązać tę zagadkę, Bingum musi lepiej poznaą swoją przeszłość. Tymczasem Grayson staje do sądowej batalii z byłym narzeczonym swojej obecnej dziewczyny Vanessy, Willem Caseyem. Musi przekonać go, by nie przenosił on fabryki do Meksyku, wskutek czego wszyscy amerykańscy pracownicy jego firmy stracą pracę. Dla Kenta to bardzo ważna sprawa, także ze względów osobistych</desc>

Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia. Na zakończenie przypomni miłośnikom gotowania przepis na tradycyjny brytyjski pudding</desc>

Wendy Simon odpadła w finale, a teraz oskarża Fowlera o spowodowanie cierpień emocjonalnych. Kim i Parker krok po kroku odkrywają tajemnice tego show i trafiają na trop prawdziwej historii miłosnej, która wydarzyła się na jego planie. Tymczasem Grayson i Jane reprezentują Evana Robbinsa, który został zwolniony z pracy z bardzo oryginalnego powodu. Po śmierci żony zaczął bowiem przeobrażać się w klauna, mimo że nie był zatrudniony w cyrku. Przychodził do pracy w kostiumie i w pełnym makijażu. W ten sposób odreagowywał stratę ukochanej. Jego współpracownicy nie potrafili zrozumieć zachowania kolegi i złożyli przeciwko niemu pozew zbiorowy</desc>

Wcześniej strzela do matki i podpala przyczepę, w której dotychczas mieszkał. Na drodze desperata stają przypadkowe osoby. Wśród nich są znudzona gospodyni domowa Donna (Gina Gershon), nienawidzący swojej pracy sprzedawca Barry (Peter Stormare), owdowiały ochroniarz Michael (Gbenga Akinnagbe) i uzależniony od seksu biznesmen Danny (Vincent D'Onofrio). Świadkiem dramatycznych zdarzeń jest również nieszczęśliwie zakochany Jeff (Cameron Monaghan), który próbuje zagłuszyć smutek narkotykami. Scenariusz produkcji powstał w oparciu o powieści znanego amerykańskiego pisarza i aktora Erica Bogosiana</desc>

Matka prześladowczyni popiera działania córki. W efekcie obie nastolatki i ich adwokaci spotykają się w sądzie. Rozpoczyna się batalia, w wyniku której także Jane pada ofiarą cyberprzemocy.

Teraz Claire chce się rozwieść, ale obawia się, że mąż nie będzie chętny, by oddać jej połowy majątku, mimo że przed laty spisali intercyzę.

    <desc lang="en">Mildred's having fun jumping high into the air with Enid - using pirated magic to make the grass bouncy. Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.</desc>

It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?.</desc>
