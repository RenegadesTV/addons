It's been a tough trip for our five teens and within minutes of arriving at the tea factory one of them feels unwell. With a man down how will the other four cope with the very physical work involved? Their boss is the strictest one yet and he is not a man to be messed with. At the end of their first shift the boss proves that he is very serious about tea when he sacks one of the team. They may be shocked but can they pull together as a team to turn this situation around? Show Me What You're Made Of is presented by Stacey Dooley</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gangsta Granny</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Schoolboy Ben is bored witless after being made to stay with his grandma. All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and none other than Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm</title>
    <desc lang="en">Harry Hill takes the title role of the absent-minded inventor, who is oblivious to the chaos caused by his ridiculous creations when they go wrong - which is more often than not. Luckily, his long-suffering housekeeper Miss Flittersnoop and dim-but-loyal best friend Colonel Dedshott are on hand to make sure he doesn't blow himself to smithereens. However, the trio meet their match when a local councillor tries to run the professor out of the village for being a dangerous nuisance, so Miss Flittersnoop's science-mad niece Connie comes to their aid. Comedy drama, co-starring Vicki Pepperdine, Simon Day and Madeline Holliday, with David Mitchell, Miranda Richardson and Ben Miller. Written by Charlie Higson from the popular children's books by Norman Hunter(n)</desc>
