    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a great day. In Jordan, eight-year-old Hamza makes lunch with his mum. In Vietnam, Truc, who is seven, makes paper butterflies at school and wins a relay race. And in Italy, seven-year-old Mario and his brother and sister spend the day at their grandma's house, dressing up and eating ice cream. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>
