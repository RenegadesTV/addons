    <title lang="en">Gladiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Five Oscars, including Best Picture, went to this epic drama about a Roman general who winds up an enslaved gladiator when he refuses to pledge loyalty to the emperor's power-hungry son. After years in the emperor's army, beloved leader Maximus simply wants to go home to his family. But when the dying ruler's scheming son declares himself Caesar, he orders Maximus executed. The resourceful former general promptly escapes, only to resurface later as an enslaved gladiator with revenge on his mind. (cc)</desc>
