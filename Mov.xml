    <desc lang="pl">Prezentacja prawdziwych, najczęściej wykonywanych w Polsce, zabiegów chirurgicznych. Tu nie ma miejsca na scenariusz. Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. 60-letni Krzysztof uskarża się na bóle w biodrze. Mężczyzna lekceważył problem, twierdząc, że to skutek przetrenowania. Kiedy środki przeciwbólowe przestały pomagać, zwrócił się po fachową poradę</desc>

Artur stara się wykorzystać swoją wiedzę i doświadczenie, by pomagać innym. Przyjechał do szpitala na konsultację z dietetykiem, bo pomimo starań przestał chudnąć.

Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. 65-letnia Teresa poznaje diagnozę - w jej piersi rośnie guz. 30- letnia Katarzyna przed dekadą przeżyła szok, gdy ginekolog powiedział jej o zmianie, jaką wyczuł w piersi.
