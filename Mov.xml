    <desc lang="en">When Peter goes to City Hall for a pool permit, he discovers that the Griffin house is not located in Quahog---or even in the U.S. And so a new nation---Petoria---is born. Not surprisingly, Peter (voice of series creator Seth MacFarlane) proves to be a saber-rattler, and that leads to a cooling in U.S.-Petorian relations. Other voices include Adam West as Quahog mayor Adam West. (repeat) (cc)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Of all the trees at Earth Mama's nursery, little Douglas fir tree Albert has the biggest ambition. He hopes to one day be the star of the show as the Christmas tree sitting at the heart of Empire City. As the festive season approaches, Albert set his mind to helping all the other plants at the nursery into the Christmas spirit. However, when a city-wide news bulletin announces the search for this year's tree, Albert spots a chance to live his dream, and sets out on a journey with help from his friends Maisie, a persistently positive palm tree, and Gene, a blisteringly honest weed. Festive animated adventure, with the voices of Bobby Moynihan, Sasheer Zamata and Judah Friedlander(n)</desc>
