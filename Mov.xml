    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>

However, now Millie has to keep up the pretence, which turns out not to be as easy as she thought. Eventually she's cornered, and forced to invite the made-up `Grant' round to tea the next day. Naturally, the entire family wants to meet this wonderful-sounding boy. Craig impresses Fran when he sticks up for Jake - and soon she's got hearts in her eyes too, to Millie and Lauren's horror. Do they need to stage an intervention - or will Craig put her off without their help?</desc>
