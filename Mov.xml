    <desc lang="en">British TV veteran Paul Greengrass ("The Murder of Stephen Lawrence") dramatically recreates the events of January 30, 1972, when in Derry, Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire and killed 14 unarmed civil rights marchers. In the decades since, specifics regarding the events of that day have fueled debate and charges of a cover-up. Using a documentary-like approach similar to "The Battle of Algiers" (1965), Greengrass presents a vivid and emotionally gripping dramatization which is "dense and alive with detail" ("Sight and Sound").</desc>

Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For a new intake of Year 7s, secondary school is a vast world that they need to navigate. This series reflects the highs and lows of it all; but ultimately it shows the CBBC viewer worried about going up to big school, that it will all be OK. In Episode One, as well as meeting some of the year 7s we will get to know throughout the series, we meet newcomer Easa, who not only doesn't speak a word of English, but has never been to school before. Social media can sometimes cause big problems in school but it can also transform the way students learn and communicate. In this episode, we discover what can go wrong when mobile phones are used in the wrong way in class - causing a fall out for some of our year 7s - and we also follow the efforts of Leo, who has ADHD and autism. He is on a mission to use social media in a good way, to let the world know what it feels like to be him. It's a big challenge - will he be able to face his fears and present his video to the whole of year 7?(n)</desc>
