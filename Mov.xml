Here they head straight to an enormous tea plantation where they grow the tea for the British export market. It's been a tough trip for our five teens and within minutes of arriving at the tea factory one of them feels unwell. With a man down how will the other four cope with the very physical work involved? Their boss is the strictest one yet and he is not a man to be messed with. At the end of their first shift the boss proves that he is very serious about tea when he sacks one of the team. They may be shocked but can they pull together as a team to turn this situation around? Show Me What You're Made Of is presented by Stacey Dooley</desc>
