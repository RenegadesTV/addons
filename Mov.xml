    <desc lang="en">Funella is very excited because it's time for the Furchester family dinner! Everyone will be heading to the dining room as soon as they've helped their guests. Mr Pickwood the beaver needs to know where some wood is, Captain Metimbers the pirate needs showing to her room and so does Matty the little mouse. With all this activity, Harvey P Dull wants to know who will look after the front desk if all the Furchesters are having a family dinner and with that Funella has moved his favourite chair in front of the desk and thanks him for helping out! The family all finally sit down for dinner, but when Furgus takes a seat he falls over. Mr Pickwood has eaten his chair! Furgus takes him to the garden and shows him the wood he CAN eat. Then Captain Metimbers interrupts, she's locked out of her treasure chest and needs Phoebe to open it. Next, Matty arrives and wants Elmo to get the bubble bath off the shelf for him as Elmo is so tall and he's so small. Then Funella hears Harvey P Dull welcoming someone WITHOUT furry arms. Funella puts some fur on Harvey's arms and shows him how to welcome guests properly. But now everyone is so busy that they can't have their family meal, it's a catastrophe! The Furchesters put their furry heads together and think, how can they have their family meal and not be interrupted by their guests? Fuzzawubba! Phoebe has a monster idea, why don't they invite their guests to dinner, after all everyone in the Furchester is like family!</desc>
