    <sub-title lang="pl">Kobiety na balu lekarzy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gretchen i doktor Kaan zbliżają się do siebie. Mimo to kobieta nie potrafi powstrzymać się przed nieustannym porównywaniem się z jego byłą ukochaną. Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego</desc>

Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu.

Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego</desc>

Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 8)</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a great day. In Jordan, eight-year-old Hamza makes lunch with his mum. In Vietnam, Truc, who is seven, makes paper butterflies at school and wins a relay race. And in Italy, seven-year-old Mario and his brother and sister spend the day at their grandma's house, dressing up and eating ice cream. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal</desc>
