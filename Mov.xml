    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Nie ma nic złego w tym, by od czasu do czasu pozwolić sobie na szybki posiłek na mieście. Z tego założenia wychodzi też prowadząca, która tym razem odwiedza londyńskie fast-foody - od lokali serwujących tajwańskie kanapki, po egzotyczne dania z Karaibów. Prowadząca udowodni, że szybkie posiłki bez problemu możemy przygotować sami. Po powrocie z miasta w swojej kuchni zaprezentuje proste przepisy na pyszne śniadanie, lunch i obiad(n)</desc>

Tannen przedstawiona jest w niej w fatalnym świetle. Bingum wie, że nie może zapobiec wydaniu książki, gdyż oznaczałoby to złamanie zasady wolności słowa. Jedynym wyjściem wydaje się wytoczenie procesu, podczas którego Tannen udowodni, że wszystko co napisała Lucas to bzdury. Wkrótce Jane wpada na genialny pomysł. Podczas rozprawy jej klienta wycofuje się jednak ze stawianych Lucas zarzutów, przez co ośmiesza swoją prawniczkę. Bingum postanawia dowiedzieć się, co się za tym kryje. Kim i Grayson reprezentują przed sądem transseksualistkę Allison Webb. Jeszcze jako mężczyzna zawarła ona związek małżeński. Żona Webb zmarła, nie pozostawiając testamentu. Teraz jej rodzice domagają się od Allison zwrotu rzeczy należących do córki. Nie mogą też zaakceptować faktu, że ich dziecko było związane z transseksualną osobą(n)</desc>

Dodatkowo przeszła kilka poważnych zabiegów - operację pękniętego płuca, wszczepienie rozrusznika serca i jego usunięcie. Po ostatniej operacji Joanna schudła 40 kilogramów. Niestety, pozostały jej fałdy skóry, które uniemożliwiają normalne funkcjonowanie. Nadmiar ciała naciska na przeponę i utrudnia oddychanie.

    <desc lang="pl">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Nie ma nic złego w tym, by od czasu do czasu pozwolić sobie na szybki posiłek na mieście. Z tego założenia wychodzi też prowadząca, która tym razem odwiedza londyńskie fast-foody - od lokali serwujących tajwańskie kanapki, po egzotyczne dania z Karaibów. Prowadząca udowodni, że szybkie posiłki bez problemu możemy przygotować sami. Po powrocie z miasta w swojej kuchni zaprezentuje proste przepisy na pyszne śniadanie, lunch i obiad(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Klientką Jane zostaje Ellie Tannen, jedna z najważniejszych osób w świecie mody. Celebrytka chce wstrzymać publikację książki, którą napisała jej była asystentka, Dawn Lucas. Tannen przedstawiona jest w niej w fatalnym świetle. Bingum wie, że nie może zapobiec wydaniu książki, gdyż oznaczałoby to złamanie zasady wolności słowa. Jedynym wyjściem wydaje się wytoczenie procesu, podczas którego Tannen udowodni, że wszystko co napisała Lucas to bzdury. Wkrótce Jane wpada na genialny pomysł. Podczas rozprawy jej klienta wycofuje się jednak ze stawianych Lucas zarzutów, przez co ośmiesza swoją prawniczkę. Bingum postanawia dowiedzieć się, co się za tym kryje. Kim i Grayson reprezentują przed sądem transseksualistkę Allison Webb. Jeszcze jako mężczyzna zawarła ona związek małżeński. Żona Webb zmarła, nie pozostawiając testamentu. Teraz jej rodzice domagają się od Allison zwrotu rzeczy należących do córki. Nie mogą też zaakceptować faktu, że ich dziecko było związane z transseksualną osobą(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gdy Joanna miała 26 lat, zdiagnozowano u niej astmę. Przez kolejne 15 lat leczenia zażywała sterydy, w wyniku czego przytyła 145 kilogramów. Dodatkowo przeszła kilka poważnych zabiegów - operację pękniętego płuca, wszczepienie rozrusznika serca i jego usunięcie. Po ostatniej operacji Joanna schudła 40 kilogramów. Niestety, pozostały jej fałdy skóry, które uniemożliwiają normalne funkcjonowanie. Nadmiar ciała naciska na przeponę i utrudnia oddychanie. Jej skóra jest bardzo cienka i boleśnie pęka przy delikatnym pociągnięciu. Joanna marzy o pozbyciu się nadmiaru skóry i przepukliny. Do tej pory lekarze odmawiali pomocy. W końcu udaje się znaleźć specjalistę, który podejmuje się wyzwania(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.</desc>

Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on. The Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics..... well nearly.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Funella is very excited because it's time for the Furchester family dinner! Everyone will be heading to the dining room as soon as they've helped their guests. Mr Pickwood the beaver needs to know where some wood is, Captain Metimbers the pirate needs showing to her room and so does Matty the little mouse. With all this activity, Harvey P Dull wants to know who will look after the front desk if all the Furchesters are having a family dinner and with that Funella has moved his favourite chair in front of the desk and thanks him for helping out! The family all finally sit down for dinner, but when Furgus takes a seat he falls over. Mr Pickwood has eaten his chair! Furgus takes him to the garden and shows him the wood he CAN eat. Then Captain Metimbers interrupts, she's locked out of her treasure chest and needs Phoebe to open it. Next, Matty arrives and wants Elmo to get the bubble bath off the shelf for him as Elmo is so tall and he's so small. Then Funella hears Harvey P Dull welcoming someone WITHOUT furry arms. Funella puts some fur on Harvey's arms and shows him how to welcome guests properly. But now everyone is so busy that they can't have their family meal, it's a catastrophe! The Furchesters put their furry heads together and think, how can they have their family meal and not be interrupted by their guests? Fuzzawubba! Phoebe has a monster idea, why don't they invite their guests to dinner, after all everyone in the Furchester is like family!.(n)</desc>
