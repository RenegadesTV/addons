    <desc lang="en">Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a champ again. When there is a challenge from a Soviet giant named Drago (Dolph Lundgren), the challenger is laughed off. The Soviet government wants the prestige of a World Heavyweight Boxing Championship and stands fully behind Drago - a cold, blond, almost-bloodless fighting machine who is somewhat inhuman. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is now Rocky's manager and is appalled by the effrontery of the challenge. To teach the upstart a lesson in boxing, Apollo agrees to an exhibition match in Las Vegas.</desc>
