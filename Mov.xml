    <desc lang="pl">Opowieść o grupie ośmiolatków z klasy II B. Każdy z chłopców jest zupełnie inny. Konieczko to typ intelektualisty, który swoją przyszłość wiąże z karierą naukową. Maślana sens życia widzi w posiadaniu, a pieniądze zamierza zdobywać wszelkimi możliwymi sposobami. Anusiak jest synem działacza związkowego i kieruje się prostymi zasadami. Czesio został szczególnie doświadczony przez los. Umarł i teraz powrócił jako zombi. To co łączy tak odmienne osobowości to chęć objęcia władzy nad światem. Każdy ma inny pomysł na to jak ją zdobyć. Na drodze do spełnienia swoich marzeń bohaterowie napotykają na rozmaite przeszkody. Ich głównym źródłem są dorośli. Najwięcej kłopotów sprawia im nauczycielka, pani Frał. Jest starą panną i chciałaby, żeby wszystkie dzieci były grzeczne, ładne i uśmiechnięte. W szkole chłopcy mają sprzymierzeńca w osobie szkolnej higienistki. Ta bardzo nieszczęśliwa wdowa kocha wszystkie dzieci na świecie.</desc>

Maślana sens życia widzi w posiadaniu, a pieniądze zamierza zdobywać wszelkimi możliwymi sposobami. Anusiak jest synem działacza związkowego i kieruje się prostymi zasadami. Czesio został szczególnie doświadczony przez los. Umarł i teraz powrócił jako zombi. To co łączy tak odmienne osobowości to chęć objęcia władzy nad światem. Każdy ma inny pomysł na to jak ją zdobyć. Na drodze do spełnienia swoich marzeń bohaterowie napotykają na rozmaite przeszkody. Ich głównym źródłem są dorośli. Najwięcej kłopotów sprawia im nauczycielka, pani Frał. Jest starą panną i chciałaby, żeby wszystkie dzieci były grzeczne, ładne i uśmiechnięte. W szkole chłopcy mają sprzymierzeńca w osobie szkolnej higienistki.

    <sub-title lang="pl">Wiedźma Shigella</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Opowieść o grupie ośmiolatków z klasy II B. Każdy z chłopców jest zupełnie inny. Konieczko to typ intelektualisty, który swoją przyszłość wiąże z karierą naukową. Maślana sens życia widzi w posiadaniu, a pieniądze zamierza zdobywać wszelkimi możliwymi sposobami. Anusiak jest synem działacza związkowego i kieruje się prostymi zasadami. Czesio został szczególnie doświadczony przez los. Umarł i teraz powrócił jako zombi. To co łączy tak odmienne osobowości to chęć objęcia władzy nad światem. Każdy ma inny pomysł na to jak ją zdobyć. Na drodze do spełnienia swoich marzeń bohaterowie napotykają na rozmaite przeszkody. Ich głównym źródłem są dorośli. Najwięcej kłopotów sprawia im nauczycielka, pani Frał. Jest starą panną i chciałaby, żeby wszystkie dzieci były grzeczne, ładne i uśmiechnięte. W szkole chłopcy mają sprzymierzeńca w osobie szkolnej higienistki. Ta bardzo nieszczęśliwa wdowa kocha wszystkie dzieci na świecie.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Pranie mózgów</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Opowieść o grupie ośmiolatków z klasy II B. Każdy z chłopców jest zupełnie inny. Konieczko to typ intelektualisty, który swoją przyszłość wiąże z karierą naukową. Maślana sens życia widzi w posiadaniu, a pieniądze zamierza zdobywać wszelkimi możliwymi sposobami. Anusiak jest synem działacza związkowego i kieruje się prostymi zasadami. Czesio został szczególnie doświadczony przez los. Umarł i teraz powrócił jako zombi. To co łączy tak odmienne osobowości to chęć objęcia władzy nad światem. Każdy ma inny pomysł na to jak ją zdobyć. Na drodze do spełnienia swoich marzeń bohaterowie napotykają na rozmaite przeszkody. Ich głównym źródłem są dorośli. Najwięcej kłopotów sprawia im nauczycielka, pani Frał. Jest starą panną i chciałaby, żeby wszystkie dzieci były grzeczne, ładne i uśmiechnięte. W szkole chłopcy mają sprzymierzeńca w osobie szkolnej higienistki. Ta bardzo nieszczęśliwa wdowa kocha wszystkie dzieci na świecie.(n)</desc>
