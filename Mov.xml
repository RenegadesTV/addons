    <desc lang="en">Twelve-year-old Romany gypsy Ben has been bullied at school as long as he can remember. Not to be held back, he has dreams of becoming a pilot, and funds his £150 lessons himself by selling eggs to the local cafe. But can he obtain his qualifications with so many interruptions to his education? Four-year-old Rudy watches his dad, professional cage fighter Tony, for the first time, and Irish traveller friends Alivia and Alicia face eviction for the second time this year.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The documentary follows 12-year-old English traveller Royston, who spends most of his spare time in the gym training. His first fight was with a bully at school and now he has several titles and is on course to turn professional. But he is not the only one. Twins Johnny and Abraham have also had trouble with bullies and have resorted to fighting back, so before they get into trouble at school, their uncle - a professional cage fighter - is taking them under his wing in a training session. Meanwhile, 10-year-old Annie recently moved from the site where she was born into a house with her mother, but she is missing her friends.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Widzowie poznają różne dania kuchni francuskiej. Autorka poradników kulinarnych, właścicielka najmniejszej restauracji w Paryżu i prezenterka, Rachel Khoo, przedstawia ciekawe przepisy na potrawy typowe dla kraju nad Loarą. Wykorzystuje swoją wiedzę, jaką zdobyła podczas nauki we francuskiej szkole dla kucharzy, Le Cordon Bleu. Rachel przyrządza tradycyjne dania, a także eksperymentuje, łącząc odmienne smaki i tradycje kulinarne. Odwiedza również mało znane zakątki francuskiej stolicy, w których można kupić rzadko spotykane artykuły spożywcze</desc>

After living through the worst tropical cyclone in memory, Felix and Luca enlist a local conservation charity to help them survey their coral reef to see the effects of the storm and check the long term damage from climate change. Protecting the marine life is vital to keep attracting the migrating whales back every year, not least because the boys' favourite hobby is taking visitors swimming to meet these magnificent animals. Join Felix and Luca as they show you what living on an Island is all about.(n)</desc>
