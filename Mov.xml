    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal</desc>
