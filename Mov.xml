Determined to harness the magical essence of the Smurfs, wicked wizard Gargamel (voice of Hank Azaria) creates a diminutive race of mischief makers known as the Naughties. But in order to get the results he's looking for, Gargamel will need to get his hands on a genuine Smurf. Enter Smurfette (voice of Katy Perry), the only one of her kind who knows the spell that can transform Naughties into actual Smurfs. Having recently shot to fame in Paris due to his impressive magical powers, Gargamel kidnaps Smurfette, and sweeps her away to the City of Light. With Papa Smurf (voice of Jonathan Winters) and company hot on his trail, however, the scheming wizard quickly realizes that executing his diabolical plan will be easier said than done. Meanwhile, Smurfette's growing sense of insecurity leaves her vulnerable to the scheming of Naughties Vexy (voice of Christina Ricci) and Hackus (voice of J.B. Smoove). Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays also lend their voices</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bart Gets an Elephant. Bill and Marty (voices of Dan Castellaneta and Harry Shearer), wacky morning drive-time DJ's on Springfield's radio station KBBL, are staging a new contest in which the winner gets to choose between two prizes -- a full grown African elephant or 10,000 dollars. Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) ends up winning the contest, and decides he wants the elephant. Bill and Marty were never expecting anyone to actually choose the elephant, and tell Bart they don't have one to give him. Bart refuses to change his mind, and after the local media picks up on the story, KBBL relents and gives Bart an elephant, which he calls Stampy. Bart loves his new pet, but Stampy is less than excited about his new environment, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) aren't sure how they'll pay for the elephant's feeding and upkeep, and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) believes Stampy should be in a jungle, where he belongs. Eventually, Homer and Marge put their feet down and tell Bart that Stampy can't stay with them; an animal sanctuary is willing to take Stampy, but they can't pay anything for him, while a less than scrupulous ivory dealer is willing to give the Simpsons a big check for the elephant, but he would almost certainly kill the animal. "Bart Gets an Elephant" first aired on March 31, 1994</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lady Bouvier's Lover. Marge and Homer Simpson (voices of Julie Kavner and Dan Castellaneta) are celebrating the birthday of their baby daughter Maggie, and since it wouldn't be a birthday party without grandparents in attendance, Homer's father, Grampa (also voiced by Castellaneta), and Marge's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier (also voiced by Kavner), are invited to join the fun. Marge thinks both Grampa and Jacqueline seem a bit lonely, and she encourages the two to spend time together. They do, and before long Grampa has fallen in love with Jacqueline. Grampa is considering popping the big question to Jacqueline during a dance at the Senior Citizen's Center when he discovers that he has a rival for her affections -- aging multi-millionaire C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer). Grampa can't match Burns' bankroll (or his dancing ability), but when he learns that Burns has planned to wed Jacqueline, he's determined to stop the ceremony however he can. Meanwhile, rabid Itchy and Scratchy fan Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) can't resist temptation when rare animation cells from the show are offered for sale on television. However, after putting 400 dollars on Homer's credit card without his permission, Bart gets his cell and discovers it's just a frame of Itchy's arm, and practically worthless. "Lady Bouvier's Lover" first aired on May 12, 1994(n)</desc>

Jamal has soon allied himself with a peasant girl and a broken-down ex-knight to defeat the evil King Leo (Kevin Conway) and his bullying minion, Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson). In the meantime, Jamal busts some modern dance moves on the medieval dance floor and encounters such intriguing residents of the period as knaves, peasants, archers, jousting knights, maidens, a princess, and even a giant. Black Knight (2001) is the sophomore directing vehicle of longtime television producer Gil Junger, who joins Lawrence in replacing the team originally attached to this comic vehicle, director F.

    <title lang="en">The Good Shepherd</title>
    <desc lang="en">One man bears witness to the secret history of America during the Cold War in this drama directed by celebrated actor Robert De Niro. In 1939, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a young man with a bright future ahead of him -- he's a top student at Yale and the protégé of one of the school's leading English professors, Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon). But Wilson's life changes dramatically when he's invited to join Yale's powerful secret society, Skull and Bones. Through his Skull and Bones connections, Wilson meets Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin), an mysterious FBI agent who asks Wilson to investigate charges that Fredericks is a Nazi sympathizer working with the German government. Later, at a Skull and Bones party, Wilson is introduced to Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie), the sister of one of his classmates and the daughter of a powerful politician; their one-night stand leaves Clover pregnant, and Wilson must leave the woman he loves, Laura (Tammy Blanchard), to wed Clover and give their child a name. Shortly after their wedding, thanks to his work with Murach, Wilson is invited to join the Office of Strategic Services, a military intelligence organization organized by Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro), and Wilson accepts. Through World War II, Wilson serves with the OSS, and learns he can trust no one in the game of international espionage, which helps make him little more than a stranger to his wife, his son, and his few friends. As the OSS evolves into the Central Intelligence Agency after the war, Wilson becomes party to America's darkest and most dangerous secrets, and in the wake of the futile Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Wilson is forced to make a terrible choice between the security of his nation and the safety of his family. Inspired by the true-life story of CIA founder James J. Angleton, The Good Shepherd boasts an impressive supporting cast, including William Hurt, John Turturro, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, and Timothy Hutton(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor/comedian Chris Rock directs and stars in this American remake of Eric Rohmer' s classic French comedy Chloe in the Afternoon. Richard Cooper (Rock) is a high-powered investment banker with a beautiful wife and two wonderful children. Though on the surface it would appear that Richard could want nothing more out of life, his thoughts always seem to drift toward sex. Whether it's during his daily commute into the city, his endless barrage of meetings, or even his downtime changing diapers at home, Richard's mind is constantly preoccupied by fantasies about the women he sees on the commuter train, on the city streets, and in the boardroom. Richard's daily life has gradually devolved into a blur of mind-numbing banality, and these days sexual fantasy has become his sole means of escaping the constant pressures of work and fatherhood. Though Richard never had any real intention of cheating on his faithful but preoccupied wife Brenda (Gina Torres), a chance run-in with his old friend Nikki (Kerry Washington) -- a drop-dead gorgeous stunner who appears at his office door one day seeking career advice from the successful banker -- finds his steely resolve fast turning flimsy. It's not long before the smitten Richard and the smoldering Nikki are meeting for clandestine lunches, and temptation begins to turn Richard's once-predictable life upside down. As his uncontrollable fantasies begin to lead him down the dangerous path of infidelity, the man who once kept his libido safely in check finds it increasingly difficult to refrain from acting on his impulses(n)</desc>

Sensitive duckling Elmer is a source of embarrassment for his macho father and an object of ridicule for other ducks his own age. Unable and unwilling to defend himself against bullies, and clearly not a "leader of ducks" like his take-charge dad, Elmer dreams of leaving his pond and going somewhere where he will be appreciated for his intellect and resourcefulness. He finally gets this opportunity, only to make a dramatic return just in time to rescue his father -- and the rest of the flock -- when hunters invade the forest. The Sissy Duckling was first telecast September 14, 1999, on HBO(n)</desc>

Things soon start to look up, however, when Dave discovers three singing chipmunks hiding out in the branches of a Christmas tree in Jett Records' world headquarters.

    <title lang="en">Enemy at the Gates</title>
    <desc lang="en">A turning point in 20th century war history is the focus of this fact-based account of the 1942-1943 battle of Stalingrad, in which the Germans were finally defeated by Russian influence -- one of the bloodiest battles in World War II history. The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper(n)</desc>

Produced entirely over the Internet, where writers uploaded story details and actors submitted audition tapes, Perkins' 14 was released into theaters as part of the third After Dark Horror Fest. Ronald Perkins was just six years old when his parents were brutally slaughtered right before his eyes. Unable to overcome the incredible trauma of witnessing such a diabolical event, Perkins becomes convinced that the killers who murdered his parents will eventually return to finish the job they started years ago -- and he plans to be fully prepared to fight back when they do. Years later, when Perkins turns 34, he kidnaps 14 people from his hometown of Stone Cove and sets about reprogramming them to become relentless killing machines. Now, if the killers ever do return, they'll have to get through Perkins' 14 in order to reach their intended target. Trouble is, now that Perkins' 14 are ready for battle, they've become increasingly difficult to contain</desc>

Agent 47 is an elite, genetically engineered assassin who takes great pride in his work. His lethal grace, steady shot, and unparalleled precision have all served to make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the world. But when the killer without a conscience is faced with an unanticipated series of developments, his entire perception of reality begins to shift. On assignment to take out Russian head of state Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), Agent 47 is caught off guard by the appearance of presidential look-alikes. When the high-profile hit captures the attention of such powerful intelligence organizations as the CIA and Interpol, agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) is dispatched to rein Agent 47 in. Meanwhile, a mysterious Russian prostitute named Nika (Olga Kurylenko) has walked into Agent 47's life, causing the methodical killer to become overwhelmed by emotions that were previously foreign to him(n)</desc>
