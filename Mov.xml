Mother Clanger is worried when she sees it snowing rather than raining, and she calls for Major Clanger to come and have a look. The Clangers have never seen snow before. Major Clanger finds it very interesting and decides to take a sample to his workshop to analyse, but he's amazed to see that it has disappeared and has been replaced by water. While Small Clanger and Baby Soup Dragon enjoy a snowball fight, Tiny Clanger spots The Cloud shivering and comes up with a clever plan. Will Tiny's plan be enough to stop The Cloud shivering?(n)</desc>
