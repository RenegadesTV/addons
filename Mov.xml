Before its current management took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common.

Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics.

Today our pesky pranksters Koala Bunnies (Svetlana and Neptune) and Prank Bosses (James and Caiden) join forces with prosthetics and make-up wiz CJ Goldman and SFX guru Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. Teams summon wizards and aliens on a busy city street corner and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life! But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? Get ready for some gut-busting reactions when Svetlana and Neptune's 'Blizzard-ade' faces off with James and Caiden's 'Alien Crash Landing'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. And for the winning team, CJ and Andy have planned the ultimate mega prank with the wackiest obstacle course challenge ever created! Exploding cakes, spraying cream and a crazed clown aren't the only obstacles to avoid on this course. If the 'target' is going to make it through, he'll have to dodge a grizzly bear too! It's one huge bear and one hilarious MEGA PRANK!(n)</desc>
