    <desc lang="en">Znawczyni gotowania Rachel Khoo powraca w swoje rodzinne strony, do Londynu, w poszukiwaniu kulinarnych inspiracji. Miłośnicy talentu słynnej Brytyjki nie będą zawiedzeni. Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Stolica Anglii to tętniąca życiem metropolia. Zatłoczone chodniki i korki na ulicach to codzienność Londynu. Mieszkanie w wielkim mieście może być męczące, dlatego Rachel od czasu do czasu pozwala sobie na chwilę wytchnienia. Dziś wybiera się na przejażdżkę rowerową i odwiedza miejski ogródek znajomego. Po powrocie do domu przyrządza kolację, na którą składa się sałatka, ciasto oraz danie wegetariańskie.(n)</desc>

W tym odcinku Rachel odkrywa bliskie związki Londynu ze Wschodem, który doskonale odzwierciedla małżeństwo jej mamy rodowitej Austriaczki i pochodzącego z Melanezji taty. Razem z przyjaciółmi zamawia danie na wynos chińskie Dim Sum. Następnie we wschodnim Londynie Rachel pod okiem miejscowego szefa kuchni zgłębia tajniki egzotycznych dań, by później już we własnej kuchni przygotować orientalnego kurczaka z malezyjską sałatką i bułeczkami na parze.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Londyńczycy kochają tradycję. Również Rachel ceni sobie tradycyjną kuchnię. Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia. Na zakończenie przypomni miłośnikom gotowania przepis na tradycyjny brytyjski pudding(n).(n)</desc>

Razem z przyjaciółmi zamawia danie na wynos chińskie Dim Sum. Następnie we wschodnim Londynie Rachel pod okiem miejscowego szefa kuchni zgłębia tajniki egzotycznych dań, by później już we własnej kuchni przygotować orientalnego kurczaka z malezyjską sałatką i bułeczkami na parze.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Londyńczycy kochają tradycję. Również Rachel ceni sobie tradycyjną kuchnię. Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia. Na zakończenie przypomni miłośnikom gotowania przepis na tradycyjny brytyjski pudding(n).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Of all the trees at Earth Mama's nursery, little Douglas fir tree Albert has the biggest ambition. He hopes to one day be the star of the show as the Christmas tree sitting at the heart of Empire City. As the festive season approaches, Albert set his mind to helping all the other plants at the nursery into the Christmas spirit. However, when a city-wide news bulletin announces the search for this year's tree, Albert spots a chance to live his dream, and sets out on a journey with help from his friends Maisie, a persistently positive palm tree, and Gene, a blisteringly honest weed. Festive animated adventure, with the voices of Bobby Moynihan, Sasheer Zamata and Judah Friedlander.(n)</desc>
