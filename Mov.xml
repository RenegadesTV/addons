Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?</desc>

Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery.

Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu.

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem (Florian David Fitz) i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem (Kai Schumann). Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

Roy can't believe it ­ he loves all of his toys and doesn't want to give any to Mrs Barker's Charity Shop, The Old Bag. Roy isn't the only family member having trouble parting with their old, unused items. Bill becomes incredibly attached to some old tight fitting clothes, and there's a scarf Maura has her eye on too. Mr Barker is just as reluctant as Roy, and when Mrs Barker is about to catch them both hiding out in Reg's shed, Roy wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy loses his brand new cape in a villainous encounter with The Messer and Glitterella. He had given Finn his old cape ­ much to Finn's delight, and is reluctant to take it back, but Finn reassures him that who we are is much more important than the things we own. Back in reality, Roy remembers this, and teaches Mr Barker how good it feels to pass things on!</desc>

Roy gives it a go and is delighted with the results. Maura, Becky, Bill and Joan are all amazed with the work Roy does on changing their looks. Roy is eager to have a makeover of his own. Joan does the honours, but every time she changes Roy's hairstyle, it plops back to its original appearance. Roy is crestfallen to realise he cannot change the way he looks. What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, Wonder Roy combats Gliterella with his new creation - a soapy water pistol. But, being Wonder Roy, he allows her the creative freedom to add a bit of sparkle to the dreary local library. Back in reality, Roy uses his creativity to fashion a wig for himself, but sadly accepts he is wasting his time. Bill points Roy's cartoon uniqueness and creative flair is something to be proud of. Roy finds solace in his dad's words and celebrates the fact he is a genius when it comes to making over people and in transforming the world around him with creativity(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this programme we visit three children who are all having an exciting day out. In Peru, seven-year-old Angel and his cousin, Santiago, go on an expedition up a mountain, where they discover lots of strange shaped rocks. In Canada, Rhys, who is eight, spends the day with his pet dog, Diva, giving her lunch, grooming her and taking her for some exercise. And in Vietnam, Truc, who is seven, shops for her mum's favourite lunch, and cooks it with her granddad. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal</desc>
