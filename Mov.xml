    <title lang="en">The Sum of All Fears</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ben Affleck takes over the role of hero CIA agent Jack Ryan in this box office hit based on the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy. Low-level analyst Ryan is elevated to prominence by his expertise on an obscure strongman (Ciaran Hinds) after the politician's surprising ascendancy to the Russian presidency. But that's just the tip of a very large, very lethal iceberg involving neo-Nazis and a nuclear warhead smuggled into the U.S. by terrorists. Morgan Freeman, Bridget Moynihan and Liev Schreiber costar in this espionage adventure.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Directors Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal weave never before seen video, candid interviews and behind the scenes performance footage into a raw and uncensored portrait of Whitney Houston, who died suddenly at age 48 after years of struggling with addiction. Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.(c)</desc>

The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mr Stink</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Twelve-year-old Chloe leads a lonely existence - her mother is too busy with her political ambitions to take any interest in her daughter, her hen-pecked dad is hiding a secret of his own and she cannot hope to compete with her `perfect' younger sister - to say nothing of the nasty girls who make her school life a misery. So when she meets a tramp in need of somewhere to stay, she invites him to hide in her family's garden shed - but it soon turns out there is more to her smelly guest than meets the eye. Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville stars, with Sheridan Smith, Johnny Vegas and Isabella Blake-Thomas, and an appearance from Britain's Got Talent winner Pudsey the dog.</desc>

Unfortunately it clashes with a rare comet sighting, which Martha and Ollie are desperate to experience. They have even been allowed to borrow the very precious school telescope for the evening. Ollie is smuggled in to Lily's house by Martha to watch secretly from the attic, with Martha planning to split her time between both events. After much chaos and confusion, and with the presence of Ollie in the house rumbled, a compromise is finally reached, where the girls all get to do both the make-over and watch the rare comet. At the end of the make-over session Martha and Jas are horrified to see Lily has transformed herself to look exactly like Greta in a bid to impress Matt. To spare Lily's feelings they pretend to like her new look, but are relieved the next day in school to see Lily returned to her normal, natural self. Lily has realised it's better to be yourself, rather than try and change who you are just to please others.</desc>
