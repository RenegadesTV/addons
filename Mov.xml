    <desc lang="en">In episode five of Show Me What You're Made Of it's their last factory in Asia and our teens make their way to a fish canning plant on the Taiwanese coast. If they thought factory work would get any easier they were sadly wrong! Some of them find the fish smell overwhelming and are horrified to discover that one job is boxing up fish heads and guts after the choice meat has been canned. Can they face their worst nightmare? Will they be able to finally show their last factory boss that they can manage a day's work even they might not want to? As they finish up in Taiwan and fly home to the UK, will they be able to show their families that their incredible trip has really changed them? Show Me What You're Made Of is presented by Stacey Dooley(n).(n)</desc>
