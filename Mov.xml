    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Larry Weinsteinberger has lost almost all of his fortune, funding appallingly bad movie ideas. Determined to stay in 'showbiz', he invests his last few dollars in setting up a TV Channel, number 6597423 in the listings. With a brand new channel and nothing to put on it, Larry then makes the classic mistake of employing Diddy Dick and Dom to take charge of programming. Diddy Dick and Dom have launched their very own TV channel! Watch 'The Great Diddy Bake Off', it's feeding time in the 'Diddy Brother' house and someone's in for a big surprise in 'Just For Pranks!'.</desc>

Matilda's in charge of the party food: build your own spicy sausage pitta bread sandwiches with zingy yoghurt sauce and popcorn cakes. The popcorn cakes idea came from Scarlet, a Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch viewer who emailed it to Matilda's Food Blog. Great food, friends and fun, and the party finishing with a bang when the guys play an explosive game with a watermelon - parties don't get much better!(n)</desc>
