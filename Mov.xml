Jeff Glor talks to Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan and the players who Pegula hopes can help spur the city toward an economic revival. Plus, Jack Ford reports on the ancient Irish game of hurling - maybe the fastest sport on turf you will ever see; and James Brown discovers a far-flung farm system for Major League Baseball in the tiny Dutch Territory of Curacao.</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit.</desc>
