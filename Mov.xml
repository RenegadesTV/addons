Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Operacja wycięcia guza na twarzy Alicji spowodowała przetokę oraz doprowadziła do zapadnięcia oka. Specjalistka chirurgii szczękowo-twarzowej zrobi wszystko, by poprawić jakość życia pacjentki(n)</desc>

Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Prezentacja prawdziwych, najczęściej wykonywanych w Polsce, zabiegów chirurgicznych. Tu nie ma miejsca na scenariusz. Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. Operacja wycięcia guza na twarzy Alicji spowodowała przetokę oraz doprowadziła do zapadnięcia oka. Specjalistka chirurgii szczękowo-twarzowej zrobi wszystko, by poprawić jakość życia pacjentki(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Historie otyłych ludzi, którzy zdecydowali się na chirurgiczny zabieg zmniejszenia żołądka. Pozbycie się zbędnych kilogramów to ich największe marzenie. Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę(n)</desc>

The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line.(n)</desc>

Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line.(n)</desc>
