    <desc lang="en">Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith star in this family martial arts adventure, a remake of the 1984 hit starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. The film is produced by the young co-lead's parents, with the action moving from America to China, and the karate consequently replaced by kung fu. After the death of his father, Dre Parker's mother Sherry takes up a job offer in Beijing, where the 11-year-old is enrolled in a local school. Sadly, it's not long before the lad falls foul of the inevitable bullies. But he's saved from a beating by the kindly caretaker Mr Han, who uses his considerable prowess to turn Dre's attackers' moves against them, to humiliating effect. Following this incident, the quiet martial arts master reluctantly agrees to teach the American child how to look after himself, starting a journey that is set to culminate in Dre's participation in a major kung fu tournament - and his chance to turn the tables on his former assailants</desc>

    <title lang="en">Georgia Rule</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Lindsay Lohan star in director Garry Marshall's tale of a rebellious young woman who is sent to spend the summer with her grandmother when her frustrated mother fails to find a means of curbing her unruly behavior. Rachel (Lohan) is an out-of-control teen whose reckless drinking, foul mouth, and hysterical fits have become a constant source of embarrassment for her long-suffering mother, Lily (Huffman). When Rachel crashes her car, Lily determines that the only way to tame her savage daughter is to take her as far away from San Francisco as possible. Though Lily had once sworn never to return to the Idaho farm presided over by her demanding mother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), desperation has a funny way of dulling the pains of the past, and it's not long before Lily is packing Rachel in the car and setting out for potato country. Contrary to the common image of the sweet and doting grandmother, Georgia is a stern matriarch whose beliefs in the power of God and a hard day's work stand in stark contrast to the carefree lifestyle of the tempestuous Rachel. An interesting thing happens as the summer wears on, though; despite her initial efforts to disrupt the quiet Mormon community, Rachel's rage is gradually tempered as she learns the value of structure and responsibility. Later, as Rachel's protective walls begin to crumble and she begins to embrace compassion and kindness, the doors are opened for three generations of family to confront the long-buried secrets of their past and finally move forward in the healing process</desc>

The setting is Los Angeles, CA, and the event is the wedding between a man and a woman who always seemed destined to be together. Unfortunately, all relationships can't be as healthy as Elise and Michael's is, and though best man and maid of honor Rich (Aaron Stanford) and Samantha (Melissa Sagemiller) seem to be preparing to take the plunge, the same certainly cannot be said for neurotic actress Lana (Mena Suvari). A free-spirited soul who has experienced flings with a variety of wedding attendees including the hapless Pockets (Jon Abrahams), alcoholic actor Simon (James Van Der Beek), and manic children's television program host Donovan (Ethan Embry), Lana attempts to sort out her past flings as lovelorn agent Quentin (Colin Hanks) pines for the bride's sister and the estranged father of the groom attempts to reconnect with his long-lost son</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sonny (Dev Patel) prepares to expand the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful while planning his impending wedding to Sunaina (Tena Desae) in this sequel that reteams director John Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker. As the contented residents of the hotel begin settling into their new lives, Sonny strives to balance the demands of planning his wedding with the responsibilities of purchasing a new property. Meanwhile, new guests Guy (Richard Gere) and Lavinia (Tamsin Greig) find themselves in a predicament after arriving at the hotel to find there is only one vacancy. Perhaps with a little innovation new co-manager Muriel (Maggie Smith) can find a means of accommodating the hotel's latest occupants, but she'll have her work cut out for her as Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Evelyn (Judi Dench) begin their new careers in Jaipur while flirting with the idea of a serious romance -- like Norman (Ronald Pickup) and Carol (Diana Hardcastle). With romance in the air it's no wonder that Madge (Celia Imrie) has her pick of handsome suitors, and as stalwart Muriel safeguards the many secrets of the vivacious residents, Sonny and Sunaina learn that planning a traditional Indian wedding can be a true test of commitment(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A murder lifts the lid on some disturbing actions among the pupils at a well-respected school in this drama. Nigel (Tom Sturridge), a student at an exclusive British private school, has been found murdered, and police detective McKenzie (Richard Roxburgh) has been assigned to investigate. Alex Forbes (Eddie Redmayne), one of Nigel's classmates who was known to have little fondness for him, is a prime suspect and has been brought in for questioning; however, he refuses to cooperate, and Sally Rowe (Toni Collette), a forensic psychiatrist working with the police, is brought in to talk to the boy. While Alex is initially no more helpful with Sally, in time she's able to find cracks in his resistance, and he begins to discuss his interest in the Knights Templar, a medieval Christian military order. As Alex shares his belief that the benefits of some actions can outweigh their wrongs, Sally learns more about the boy, and her research turns up some surprising facts – Nigel believed both he and Alex were descended from members of the Knights Templar, they may have been responsible for the death of a schoolmate in the interest of gaining mystical powers, and Alex's father (Patrick Malahide), also the headmaster at the school, has some troubling secrets of his own.

Agent 47 is an elite, genetically engineered assassin who takes great pride in his work. His lethal grace, steady shot, and unparalleled precision have all served to make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the world. But when the killer without a conscience is faced with an unanticipated series of developments, his entire perception of reality begins to shift. On assignment to take out Russian head of state Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), Agent 47 is caught off guard by the appearance of presidential look-alikes. When the high-profile hit captures the attention of such powerful intelligence organizations as the CIA and Interpol, agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) is dispatched to rein Agent 47 in. Meanwhile, a mysterious Russian prostitute named Nika (Olga Kurylenko) has walked into Agent 47's life, causing the methodical killer to become overwhelmed by emotions that were previously foreign to him(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">What Happens in Vegas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two strangers (Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher) find themselves hitched after a wild night of Las Vegas shenanigans in this 20th Century Fox comedy. Jack Fuller (Kutcher) is a single Manhattanite who can never quite commit to a permanent, long-term relationship and repeatedly hears from his lovers that he "isn't serious boyfriend material." Employed by his father (Treat Williams) at a local furniture business, Jack spends his workdays goofing off by watching sporting events behind dad's back. Joy McNally (Diaz) is faring slightly better; a young, polished urbanite, she juggles a demanding job as a trader on the NYSE with a marital engagement to the impressive Mason (Jason Sudeikis), but has modified her entire life and all of her interests to please her intended. Coincident with Mr. Fuller's decision to fire his son, Mason severs his engagement to Joy; as a result, both Jack and Joy hit the skids at around the same time and decide to cut their losses by heading out to Vegas. The two accidentally bump into one another when a computer mix-up at the hotel puts them in adjoining rooms; though they begin their acquaintanceship by bickering endlessly, they end up spending a long, drunken night on the town together, and when the sun rises and Joy comes to, she discovers that she unwittingly married Jack in the middle of the night. Alas, just when the two are about to call it quits by filing for divorce after the shortest marriage in history, Jack tosses a coin into a Vegas slot machine and hits a three-million-dollar jackpot -- which naturally pits the newlyweds against one another in an attempt to claim the full share of the money. A conservative local judge, R.D. Whopper (Dennis Miller), then adds the final twist by refusing to grant a divorce until Joy and Jack have given married life a fair shake. In time, the marrieds may just discover that this union isn't as far off the mark as they initially thought. Dennis Farina, Queen Latifah, and Zach Galifianakis round out the supporting cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An ordinary day in Green Park begins with Eve helping Will to cheat on his homework and Abe teaching Eve the importance of `dares'. But then Will's mum, Rebecca, arrives from Dubai. Nick is adamant that Rebecca must not learn the truth about Eve. Will is upset that his dad doesn't trust his mum. Meanwhile, Zac returns from Cuba determined to win Eve back. Eve is initially uncertain that she wants to be won back. Zac goes all out to prove his good intentions, but as Eve starts to think more positively about Zac, her body seems to protect her from her feelings and drives her away from Zac. At dinner with his mum Will asks tough questions about her disappearance from his life and realises why Rebecca has come back. They get interrupted when Will spots Mr Gwenlan - who is supposed to be in prison. Mr Gwenlan chases after Will and finally corners him.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">With Mr Gwenlan on the loose, Katherine wants Eve to be locked up at Calimov. Eve and Nick talk her out of it as long as Eve stays out of trouble. Yet when Eve offers to babysit Zoe, Lily's tearaway cousin, staying out of trouble seems wholly unlikely. To understand the behaviour of 'small humans' Eve lets Zoe run riot in the local park. Zoe gets bored, and with Abe's advice, Eve lets Zoe eat as many ice creams as she wants. Things get messy and Will and Lily aren't impressed. But as Eve promises to impose a strict new regime on young Zoe, Will wants to give Eve a second chance. Katherine is less interested in second chances and when she realises that Mr Gwenlan stole a spiderbot from Calimov she's determined that Eve be kept under lock and key. Meanwhile, Zoe rebels against Eve and runs away. The gang can't find her anywhere. By the time Nick and Katherine arrive to check up on Eve, all's well and Eve is the picture of innocence. If only the same could be true of Abe, whose plan to avoid household chores backfires spectacularly.</desc>

Once Eve gives the mobiles a turbo boost they start to sell like hot cakes. Abe is delighted until Eve sells a phone to Isaac, a young wheelchair user, for double the price. For Abe, a business line has been crossed - he even ends up paying Isaac to get the phone back. In another part of the business world, to protect Calimov from PRICE, Katherine has designed a new security system called Quincy. But when Quincy fails to stop a hack, Eve's secret is at risk. Eve herself is busy in the park teaching some manners to a gang of older boys, which leads Isaac to discovering something different about Eve. Isaac demands the gang's friendship in return for keeping Eve's secret. Eve's identity is under even more threat at Calimov where Nick uses Quincy's flagging power to launch a counterattack against PRICE. When Lord Hoffman arrives to pressure Katherine to back down, all seems to be lost. And with PRICE trying to hit Mary too and Adam failing to respond to her messages, Mary issues Adam with a new command - he must deal with Eve immediately.(n)</desc>
