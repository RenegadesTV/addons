    <sub-title lang="pl">Doktor Kaan jest milutki!</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Haase odkrywa, że doktor Kaan może i uchodzi za dziwaka, lecz ma dobre serce. Lekarz udziela nieodpłatnej pomocy osobom, których nie stać na leczenie. Gretchen i doktor Hassmann, neurochirurg, operują Jenny, dziewczynę z nizin społecznych, która ukradła lekarce portfel. Gaby obmyśla plan, jak usidlić Meiera. Wpada na pewien pomysł. Barbara zapisuje się z córką na zajęcia z fitnessu, by podnieść swoją atrakcyjność w oczach męża. W ośrodku zdrowia wpada na kochankę męża, Elke. Wynikają z tego duże kłopoty, gdyż Gretchen nie umie trzymać języka za zębami(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase (Diana Amft) ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery.

Gretchen i doktor Hassmann, neurochirurg, operują Jenny, dziewczynę z nizin społecznych, która ukradła lekarce portfel. Gaby obmyśla plan, jak usidlić Meiera. Wpada na pewien pomysł. Barbara zapisuje się z córką na zajęcia z fitnessu, by podnieść swoją atrakcyjność w oczach męża. W ośrodku zdrowia wpada na kochankę męża, Elke. Wynikają z tego duże kłopoty, gdyż Gretchen nie umie trzymać języka za zębami(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki</title>
    <sub-title lang="pl">Zakonnice też są kobietami</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Gretchen i doktor Kaan zbliżają się do siebie. Mimo to kobieta nie potrafi powstrzymać się przed nieustannym porównywaniem się z jego byłą ukochaną. Tłumione kompleksy sprawiają, że może chwilowo zapomnieć o diecie. Na oddział trafia ciężarna zakonnica ze złamaną nogą. Nagle kobieta zaczyna rodzić. Meier w drodze wyjątku wyraża więc zgodę na to, by na chirurgii pomagał doktor Kaan. Barbara zapisuje się na jazdę konną. Dzięki nowemu hobby nie tylko zapomina o samotności, lecz także poznaje przystojnego chirurga plastycznego. Niewierny mąż robi się zazdrosny o jej nowego znajomego(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">RANK THE PRANK - pranking Hollywood style! Today our pesky pranksters are Dukafundis (Markus and Ellysa) and 'Very Intelligent Pranksters' (Evan and Ashazia) who team up with digital effects wizard Hassan Aziz and SFX specialists Marc Reichel and Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. The teams take over a bowling alley and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's strike three for the targets when Markus and Ellysa's 'Haunted Alley' dukes it out with Evan and Ashazia's 'Hotdog Bowler'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, the effectors have planned the ultimate MEGA PRANK at a car wash featuring a dirty car, a nervous driver and a meteor shower! Our 'target' may be able to avoid the meteor but will mom's car be able to do the same? One thing's for sure, this explosively entertaining mega prank strikes comedy gold!(n)</desc>

Today teams invade an office building and for unsuspecting targets, it's going to be anything but another... day at the office!

For the winning team, Marc, Andy and Devon have planned a MEGA PRANK packed with ninja power! The setting is a martial arts dojo, complete with flying rigs, flying crates and flying people! Will the targets flap their wings and take flight too? One thing's for sure, this MEGA PRANK is gonna be fly!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we drop in on three seven-year-olds who are all having a very busy day. In Vietnam, Truc takes pity on her lonely goldfish and goes shopping for some companions. In Russia, Liza and her twin brother, Styopa, take part in a craft class and make a lucky horseshoe for someone special. And in Jordan, Hamza makes a pizza for a picnic with his family in the local park - and scores a goal against his dad. We see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and discoveries of childhood are universal(n)</desc>
