    <title lang="en">Drugstore Cowboy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Without adopting the romantic and moralistic cliches that have crippled many other films about addiction, Gus Van Sant directs Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, James Le Gros and Heather Graham in one of the most influential films of the late 1980s. Bob (Dillon) is the leader of a small gang of junkies that robs pharmacies and hospitals for prescription drugs. Alas, Bob is now starting to feel the burden of responsibility as he watches over his band of misfits. Van Sant's joyous and exhilarating second feature is notable for its humor and bravery.</desc>
