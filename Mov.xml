    <desc lang="en">Light-hearted documentary shedding light on the lives of people whose extravagant tastes often leave their parents or significant others substantially out of pocket. These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiance as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.(n)</desc>

Dzięki swojej inteligencji zamierza przejąć kiedyś władzę nad światem. Póki co wiedza przeszkadza mu w codziennej komunikacji z otoczeniem. Anusiak odznacza się największym brakiem kultury i jest najsilniejszy wśród kolegów. Jest synem chłopa i planuje kiedyś założyć związek zawodowy.
