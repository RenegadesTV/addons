    <title lang="en">New Wave: Dare to be Different</title>
    <desc lang="en">In August, 1982, a small group of radio visionaries at WLIR Long Island knew they couldn't compete with the mega radio stations in New York City. With one brave decision, they changed the sound of radio forever. Program Director Denis McNamara, the crew at the station and the biggest artists of the era tell the story of how they battled the FCC, the record labels, mega-radio and all the conventional rules to create a musical movement that brought the New Wave to America - including bands like U2, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode and Blondie.</desc>

When the local sheriff brings in a body found in the basement of a home, it seems like just another open-and-shut case. As the autopsy proceeds however, they are left reeling as the inspection brings new revelations. Perfectly preserved on the outside, Jane Doe seems to have been the victim of a horrific ritualistic torture. Tommy and Austin begin to piece together these gruesome discoveries, as an unnatural force takes hold of the crematorium.</desc>

Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.(n)</desc>
