Grayson szybko ulega urokowi atrakcyjnej celebrytki. Nie ułatwia mu to koncentracji nad sprawą. Tymczasem Kim i Preston znów przychodzą razem do pracy, co wywołuje lawinę plotek i spekulacji. Oboje zajmują się sprawą właścicielki hotelu, któremu grozi bankructwo. Wszystko przez niepochlebne opinie o jej pensjonacie, które pojawiają się ostatnio w internetowym przewodniku turystycznym. Kobieta jest przekonana, że jego autorzy mszczą się w ten sposób za to, że zrezygnowała z zamieszczenia reklamy na ich stronie. Właścicielka żąda finansowego zadośćuczynienia za zniesławienie. Rozpoczyna się proces, podczas którego na jaw wychodzi wiele interesujących faktów..</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Jane i Grayson zostają obrońcami piosenkarki Tiny Orlando z duetu Confetti. Ona i jej siostra są oskarżone o zabójstwo swojego menedżera, Chrisa Fabrikanta. Grayson szybko ulega urokowi atrakcyjnej celebrytki. Nie ułatwia mu to koncentracji nad sprawą. Tymczasem Kim i Preston znów przychodzą razem do pracy, co wywołuje lawinę plotek i spekulacji. Oboje zajmują się sprawą właścicielki hotelu, któremu grozi bankructwo. Wszystko przez niepochlebne opinie o jej pensjonacie, które pojawiają się ostatnio w internetowym przewodniku turystycznym. Kobieta jest przekonana, że jego autorzy mszczą się w ten sposób za to, że zrezygnowała z zamieszczenia reklamy na ich stronie. Właścicielka żąda finansowego zadośćuczynienia za zniesławienie. Rozpoczyna się proces, podczas którego na jaw wychodzi wiele interesujących faktów..</desc>

Podróż po tętniącej życiem brytyjskiej stolicy to zarówno dla prowadzącej, jak i widzów pełne intrygujących doznań, widoków, dźwięków, oraz rzecz jasna smaków, niezapomniane doświadczenie zamknięte w dziesięciu inspirujących odcinkach. Rachel z nostalgią i rozrzewnieniem wspomina swoje dzieciństwo spędzone w Londynie. Z sentymentem wraca pamięcią do dań, które wówczas bardzo jej smakowały i postanawia jeszcze raz ich skosztować. Udaje się do bistro, w którym oferowane są austriackie słodkości i wraz z szefem kuchni piecze ulubione rodzinne ciasto - strudel. Przyrządza też lody włoskie, których smak kojarzy się z starymi dobrymi czasami. Nieodzowną pomocą okazują się przepisy mamy i babci Rachel</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.(n)</desc>
