    <desc lang="en">For Martha (Martina Gedeck), the tightly-wound workaholic chef at the center of Sandra Nettelbeck's charming and unsentimental romantic comedy, cooking is the way to effectively relate to others. A skilled and respected professional at a fancy high-end Italian restaurant in Hamburg, Martha lives a solitary life away from her immaculate kitchen. Yet some life-changing surprises are in store when Martha must take custody of her orphaned eight-year-old niece and her professional domain is invaded by an exuberant new sous-chef (Sergio Castellitto).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Pełne odważnego humoru perypetie czterech ośmiolatków z klasy II b. Najmądrzejszy z całej paczki Konieczko jest zdeklarowanym ateistą. Dzięki swojej inteligencji zamierza przejąć kiedyś władzę nad światem. Póki co wiedza przeszkadza mu w codziennej komunikacji z otoczeniem. Anusiak odznacza się największym brakiem kultury i jest najsilniejszy wśród kolegów. Jest synem chłopa i planuje kiedyś założyć związek zawodowy. Najbogatszy i najsprytniejszy Maślana to kapitalista, który jest przekonany, że wszystko można kupić.

Cała czwórka nieustannie naraża się swojej nauczycielce, surowej pani Frał. Niesforne łobuzy często też dokuczają koleżance z klasy, Andżelice, która przeprowadziła się z rodzicami do Polski ze Stanów.

    <desc lang="en">With just 2 years' experience, Scottish teenager Iona has only five months to prepare for the biggest international competition of her life, the World Junior Surf Championships in the Azores, Portugal. It's a race against time as she trains in sub-zero conditions and battles the unpredictable seas of her home shores to find the perfect wave. It's punishing but day after day Iona dons her wetsuit and dives in. But surfing off Scotland's coast is a world away from the warm, volcanic waters of the Azores, where Iona will be up against the gnarliest (treacherous) waves she has ever faced as well as some of the most experienced and fearless surfers on the planet. Determined not to let herself or her country down, will Iona master the surf - and the pressure - to come home a champion?</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Hamza,Truc and Anushka: Truc has a little sleep - at school</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.</desc>

They find Ned who shows Melody the electric guitar and acoustic guitar and demonstrates the sounds they make. Melody and her mum then hurry to meet Melody's friends who are also going to watch Ned give a recital of Bach's Cello Suite, No 2, First Movement. Melody is looking forward to knowing what the music will make her friends think of. The music begins, and Melody's imagination, with the help of animation gets to work. Mum and Melody then go and meet the friends, where the music is played again and with animation we see what the music makes the friends think of.</desc>
