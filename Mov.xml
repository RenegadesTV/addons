Tarantino also talks about great comic performances, such as Cary Grant in "His Girl Friday" (1940), Eli Wallach in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966) and Rex Harrison in "Unfaithfully Yours" (1948).

Big Bird realises he's forgotten to tell Santa that he's staying at The Furchester Hotel for Christmas and is worried that Santa won't know where to deliver his presents. Elmo and the other guests haven't told Santa either and become really worried. Will Santa know where to deliver their presents? It's too late to get a letter to the North Pole, so the Furchesters try to distract all the guests with their Christmas activities. However, every mention of Santa makes everyone worried again, they don't finish any of the activities they started. And Phoebe is disappointed that she can't enjoy her Christmas the way the Furchesters planned it. With the help of Harvey P Dull, Elmo and Big Bird realise there's more to Christmas than presents, and that sharing traditions and celebrating together is what makes Christmas so special</desc>

So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!(n)</desc>
