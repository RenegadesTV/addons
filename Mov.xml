    <sub-title lang="pl">Jak okazywać emocje?</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">30-letnia Agnieszka z Częstochowy do niedawna prowadziła własny zakład fryzjerski. Uśmiechnięta i miła zawsze dbała o dobre samopoczucie swoich klientek. Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać.

Potrafiła też im doradzić, w razie potrzeby także pocieszyć. Niedawno dowiedziała się jednak, że wykryto u niej nowotwór złośliwy. Diagnoza spowodowała, że Agnieszka zamknęła swój salon. Choć w tym trudnym czasie wspierał ją mąż, kobieta straciła motywację do jakichkolwiek działań, przestała wychodzić z domu. Z reguły otwarta i wesoła, zaczęła mieć problem z wyrażaniem swoich emocji. Agnieszka chciałaby nauczyć się mówić wprost o tym, co czuje, ale nie potrafi się przełamać. Trener personalny i terapeutka Joanna Godecka podpowiedzą jej co zrobić, aby na nowo otworzyć się na świat i ludzi</desc>

Następnie przeprowadzają stymulację pokazującą, jak będzie się zmieniał ich stan zdrowia w ciągu najbliższych kilkunastu czy nawet kilkudziesięciu lat. Wyniki są zastraszające - dzieciom często grozi nie tylko nadwaga, ale też cukrzyca czy nadciśnienie. Na podstawie zebranych informacji zespół ekspertów przygotowuje plan działania, który ma pomóc rodzinom zmienić złe nawyki i odmienić bieg wydarzeń. Od rodziców zależy, czy zastosują się do wskazówek specjalistów</desc>
