    <desc lang="pl">21-letnia Paulina z Warszawy pracuje w call center. Dziewczyna jest szczęśliwą matką 1,5-rocznej córeczki, niedługo ma też wziąć ślub z Dominikiem, ojcem dziecka. Największym problemem Pauliny jest jednak jej ciało. Jej figura po ciąży bardzo się zmieniła i trudno jej zaakceptować ten fakt. Jej rozmiar powiększył się z 34 na 42.Praca, wychowanie dziecka i prowadzenie domu powodują, że Paulina nie ma czasu i sił, aby zająć się sobą. We własnej skórze czuje się tak źle, że wycofała się nawet z życia towarzyskiego. Marzy, aby znów stać się taka jak dawniej - przebojowa, towarzyska i pełną energii. Widzowie przekonają się, czy uda jej się osiągnąć ten cel i czy problemy z figurą, to jedyny powód zmartwień w życiu Pauliny</desc>

W pracy lekarze nie są w stanie ukrywać swojej fascynacji. Na kursie pierwszej pomocy Kaan zaczyna otwarcie rywalizować z Markiem o uwagę Gretchen. Z kolei kochanka Meiera, pielęgniarka Gaby, knuje przeciwko Haase intrygę, by ją skompromitować. Matka Gretchen podejmuje walkę o ratowanie swojego małżeństwa.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Co zrobić z tą figurą?</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">21-letnia Paulina z Warszawy pracuje w call center. Dziewczyna jest szczęśliwą matką 1,5-rocznej córeczki, niedługo ma też wziąć ślub z Dominikiem, ojcem dziecka. Największym problemem Pauliny jest jednak jej ciało. Jej figura po ciąży bardzo się zmieniła i trudno jej zaakceptować ten fakt. Jej rozmiar powiększył się z 34 na 42.Praca, wychowanie dziecka i prowadzenie domu powodują, że Paulina nie ma czasu i sił, aby zająć się sobą. We własnej skórze czuje się tak źle, że wycofała się nawet z życia towarzyskiego. Marzy, aby znów stać się taka jak dawniej - przebojowa, towarzyska i pełną energii. Widzowie przekonają się, czy uda jej się osiągnąć ten cel i czy problemy z figurą, to jedyny powód zmartwień w życiu Pauliny</desc>

Największym problemem Pauliny jest jednak jej ciało. Jej figura po ciąży bardzo się zmieniła i trudno jej zaakceptować ten fakt. Jej rozmiar powiększył się z 34 na 42.Praca, wychowanie dziecka i prowadzenie domu powodują, że Paulina nie ma czasu i sił, aby zająć się sobą. We własnej skórze czuje się tak źle, że wycofała się nawet z życia towarzyskiego. Marzy, aby znów stać się taka jak dawniej - przebojowa, towarzyska i pełną energii. Widzowie przekonają się, czy uda jej się osiągnąć ten cel i czy problemy z figurą, to jedyny powód zmartwień w życiu Pauliny</desc>

W pracy lekarze nie są w stanie ukrywać swojej fascynacji. Na kursie pierwszej pomocy Kaan zaczyna otwarcie rywalizować z Markiem o uwagę Gretchen. Z kolei kochanka Meiera, pielęgniarka Gaby, knuje przeciwko Haase intrygę, by ją skompromitować. Matka Gretchen podejmuje walkę o ratowanie swojego małżeństwa.

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Maura sends him out to the garden to play, but desperate to know how the episode ends, he sneaks back to watch the TV. When Becky surprises him, he accidentally swallows the remote! Grabbing his belly, Roy discovers that every time he presses a button it activates him instead of the TV. 'Fast Forward' and he starts speeding around, 'Pause' and he stops. Meanwhile, Bill is getting anxious; the footy starts soon and where is the remote? Maura and Bill find Roy in the garden paused under the sprinkler. Roy, desperate to keep his secret from everyone, promises he's just taking a shower, but Maura is suspicious. What would Wonder Roy do?</desc>

All except Miss Hardbroom who balks at hearing the rival school will be visiting, and Mildred who will be one of the contestants. Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred(n)</desc>
