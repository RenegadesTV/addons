    <desc lang="pl">Zwykły dzień doktor Haase zaczyna od śniadania. Później należy sprawdzić, co u doktora Meiera i kontynuować wojnę z pielęgniarką Gabi. Potem drugie śniadanie. W planie dnia upokorzenie ze strony chorego na raka pacjenta i rozmowa z matką o jej dużo młodszym partnerze o artystycznej duszy. Informacja o zostaniu druhną wyprowadza Gretchen z równowagi na tyle, że lekarka znów zapomina o diecie. Nadchodzi czas na lunch, ciastko i kawę, a zaraz po nich drugi lunch. Po tych wszystkich rewelacjach Haase nie ma siły pocieszać doktora Kaana, który poznał nieciekawe fakty z życia swojej żony. Lekarka rezygnuje więc z kolacji</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 12)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki. Sukces nie zagłusza w niej chęci poznania odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy seks pod prysznicem jest wygodny. Chciałaby rozwiać swoje wątpliwości w tej kwestii</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 13)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">W przeciwieństwie do Heidi Klum Gretchen nie przepada za rywalizacją. Ma pecha, gdyż doktor Knechtlsdorfer, z którym ubiega się o posadę starszego asystenta, wprost to uwielbia. Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia. W jej życiu pojawia się bogacz, który ma ochotę na bliższą znajomość. Będzie się działo!</desc>

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha.

W towarzystwie jednego z nich Haase wybierze się do Las Vegas, nie wiadomo jednak, czy zamierza tam spróbować szczęścia w kasynie czy wziąć szybki ślub. Gabi dokona przerażającego odkrycia, które jest związane z mężczyzną o imieniu Kalle. Nie zabraknie seksu, trzech propozycji małżeństwa, tajemniczej plantacji marihuany - ale niestety nie oznacza to szczęśliwego zakończenia(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 11)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zwykły dzień doktor Haase zaczyna od śniadania. Później należy sprawdzić, co u doktora Meiera i kontynuować wojnę z pielęgniarką Gabi. Potem drugie śniadanie. W planie dnia upokorzenie ze strony chorego na raka pacjenta i rozmowa z matką o jej dużo młodszym partnerze o artystycznej duszy. Informacja o zostaniu druhną wyprowadza Gretchen z równowagi na tyle, że lekarka znów zapomina o diecie. Nadchodzi czas na lunch, ciastko i kawę, a zaraz po nich drugi lunch. Po tych wszystkich rewelacjach Haase nie ma siły pocieszać doktora Kaana, który poznał nieciekawe fakty z życia swojej żony. Lekarka rezygnuje więc z kolacji</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Haase ratuje życie chłopcu choremu na nerki. Sukces nie zagłusza w niej chęci poznania odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy seks pod prysznicem jest wygodny. Chciałaby rozwiać swoje wątpliwości w tej kwestii</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">W przeciwieństwie do Heidi Klum Gretchen nie przepada za rywalizacją. Ma pecha, gdyż doktor Knechtlsdorfer, z którym ubiega się o posadę starszego asystenta, wprost to uwielbia. Lekarz nie cofnie się przed najgorszą podłością, byle tylko zdobyć upragnione stanowisko. Polem bitwy staje przypadek chorego na raka pacjenta. By wzbudzić w sobie wolę walki, Gretchen próbuje przypomnieć sobie traumatyczne zdarzenie ze swojej młodości, przez które unika konfrontacji jak ognia.

W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Do szpitala trafia matka Meiera. Cierpi na wrzody żołądka. Gretchen przenosi się w świat fantazji. Snuje rozważania na temat powieści 'Dr. Rogelt' i swojej roli w przedstawionej tam historii miłosnej(n)</desc>

W towarzystwie jednego z nich Haase wybierze się do Las Vegas, nie wiadomo jednak, czy zamierza tam spróbować szczęścia w kasynie czy wziąć szybki ślub. Gabi dokona przerażającego odkrycia, które jest związane z mężczyzną o imieniu Kalle. Nie zabraknie seksu, trzech propozycji małżeństwa, tajemniczej plantacji marihuany - ale niestety nie oznacza to szczęśliwego zakończenia(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley(n)</desc>

The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line</desc>
