Z kolei Bożena i Olga idą na siłownię, by zgubić kilka kilogramów przed zabiegiem. Na miejscu spotykają Karolinę, która również musi schudnąć. Emil i Ela po operacji jedzą swój pierwszy posiłek - kleik. Tymczasem na siłowni Karolina zaczyna mieć problem z kręgosłupem i musi opuścić salę treningową. Bożena i Olga wyciskają siódme poty. Emil po powrocie ze szpitala postanawia nauczyć swojego pupila Dolara posłuszeństwa i zapisuje go na tresurę, co też zwiększa aktywność chłopaka. Ela po incydentach z ciśnieniem zaczyna regularnie je kontrolować. Bożena i Olga przechodzą próbę wagi</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Serce na warsztat!</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">Gdy Joanna miała 26 lat, zdiagnozowano u niej astmę. Przez następnych 15 lat kobieta była poddawana leczeniu sterydami, co spowodowało u niej przyrost wagi do 145 kg. Oprócz tego chora przeszła liczne zabiegi: operację pękniętego płuca oraz wszczepienie i usunięcie rozrusznika serca. Po ostatniej interwencji chirurgicznej lekarze nie dawali Joannie większych szans na przeżycie. Rok po zabiegu pacjentka schudła 40 kg, jednak na jej ciele pozostały fałdy skóry; nadmiar ciała uciska przeponę i utrudnia oddychanie. W dodatku skóra jest niezwykle wrażliwa, pęka przy nawet delikatnym pociągnięciu. Ze względu na duże ryzyko lekarze odmawiali Joannie przeprowadzenia kolejnej operacji. W końcu kobiecie udało się znaleźć specjalistę, który może pomóc jej wrócić do normalnego życia. W przygotowaniach do zabiegu wspierają ją ukochany mąż i dzieci(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Gdy Joanna miała 26 lat, zdiagnozowano u niej astmę. Przez następnych 15 lat kobieta była poddawana leczeniu sterydami, co spowodowało u niej przyrost wagi do 145 kg. Oprócz tego chora przeszła liczne zabiegi: operację pękniętego płuca oraz wszczepienie i usunięcie rozrusznika serca. Po ostatniej interwencji chirurgicznej lekarze nie dawali Joannie większych szans na przeżycie. Rok po zabiegu pacjentka schudła 40 kg, jednak na jej ciele pozostały fałdy skóry; nadmiar ciała uciska przeponę i utrudnia oddychanie. W dodatku skóra jest niezwykle wrażliwa, pęka przy nawet delikatnym pociągnięciu. Ze względu na duże ryzyko lekarze odmawiali Joannie przeprowadzenia kolejnej operacji. W końcu kobiecie udało się znaleźć specjalistę, który może pomóc jej wrócić do normalnego życia. W przygotowaniach do zabiegu wspierają ją ukochany mąż i dzieci(n)</desc>

To Nick and Eve's horror, Katherine reveals her new range of childbots, which have been placed with local families. To prevent Katherine restoring KT to factory settings, Eve smuggles her out of Calimov and back to the Clarke house. But with Will and Lily insisting KT is returned to Calimov, Eve and her sister are forced to take matters into their own hands. The situation escalates when Katherine's childbots start to malfunction and it is KT who comes under suspicion, admitting she has no wish to pass as human. In order to make Eve prove she loves her sister as she is, KT wants Eve to reveal her own robot identity to the world. Trapped inside the house by the childbots, and with police and reporters gathering outside, the gang's worst fears have been realised. With Eve about to admit her secret to the world on live TV, can Will's nanobots save the day?.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rebecca and Nick are desperate to get to the bottom of Will's nanobot problem, so they take him into Calimov to run some tests. Whilst there, Nick insists that Katherine deactivate KT after the trouble she has caused, but Katherine has other ideas. Meanwhile Abe is disgruntled after Lily refuses to help him with his homework - she's more interested in her date with Cain. Maddy has her hands full preparing for the arrival of the new baby and tells Abe that it's time he grew up and took some responsibility for himself. A dejected Abe goes to Eve for help. As Eve completes his homework, Abe wonders aloud what's so special about babies - why do they get everyone's attention? After researching human child-rearing, Eve cites 'helplessness' as the main reason. Inspired, a scheming Abe fakes being ill to regain Maddy's attention, but his plan backfires. Suspecting Abe has appendicitis a concerned Maddy calls an ambulance! Once again Abe begs Eve for help and so Eve hacks the local traffic control system, gridlocking the roads and preventing the emergency services from getting through. The situation escalates when Maddy unexpectedly goes into labour. With the roads blocked, Abe must man-up and help his mum - while Eve goes for help. Across town Will crashes Lily's date revealing that Cain is a fully paid up member of anti-tech group PRICE. At Calimov, under Katherine's interrogation, KT reveals how Will ended the childbot siege using his nanobots. Katherine now has the leverage she needs to persuade Nick to keep KT online. At the Watsons', Eve and the gang return with help - to find Abe has successfully delivered his baby brother!.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For the umpteenth time Eve defeats her friends at gaming, singing a football chant in triumph. Eve explains how, in a matter of nanoseconds, her predictive software allows her to always choose the best possible course of action - hence the winning streak. But it cannot predict random events like lottery numbers, much to Abe's disappointment. Unknown to the gang, Cain waits outside with Michael Hoffman, the son of the late Lord Hoffman. In their attempts to find rogue robots, Cain pitches his theory that - given the multiple incidents involving robot activity at the Clarke house, plus Nick's prior history with Mary Douglas - this is a good place to start. When the doorbell rings, Eve answers to find Cain and Michael. Detecting their concealed EMPs, she slams the door on them. Spooked by this odd behaviour they break in, fearful that there may be another robot siege in progress. Once inside they learn that Eve is the robot and blast her with their EMPs - only for time to rewind. This has simply been a simulation in Eve's predictive software! Eve runs multiple simulations trying to find a way to stop Cain and Michael discovering her robot nature, but in each one her identity is exposed and Cain and Michael destroy her. With time running out, Eve recruits the Will and Lily simulations. Lily speculates that Eve is experiencing anxiety. She has become so human, that it has caused her predictive software to malfunction. Eve must disable the software and go it alone. Although Eve manages to evade discovery, neither she nor the gang realise that, while inside, Cain has bugged Nick's computer and is one step closer to the truth.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mary resorts to extreme measures to head off the threat of Cain and PRICE, enlisting KT to help her temporarily transfer her consciousness to Eve. With KT AWOL from Calimov, a distracted Nick and Katherine welcome back Zac, who is helping them answer questions about how Mary was able to duplicate his personality. Excited about Zac's return, Eve suggests he join the gang's picnic that afternoon. To everyone's surprise Zac brings his new girlfriend, and for the first time Eve experiences jealousy. Spotting KT hovering nearby puts Eve on high alert. Operating under Protocol Zero, KT is Mary's automaton, and is primed to execute her mother's plan. Meanwhile, on Abe's misguided advice, Eve kisses Will in an attempt to make Zac jealous. For a moment, in robot communion, Will sees inside Eve's mind and then passes out. In the ensuing chaos, KT places a magnetic patch containing Mary's consciousness onto Eve. Inhabiting Eve's robot body, Mary begins to question Cain about PRICE. Separately, a revived Will tells Lily that when he kissed Eve he could see inside her systems. They theorise that this made her malfunction and fixate on the idea of jealousy - perhaps she is attempting to make Zac jealous by paying Cain so much attention? Little do they realise the truth. Later, Eve - still possessed by Mary - meets Cain in the park, where she interrogates him about PRICE's super-EMP. Mary decides that Cain must be terminated. Will intervenes in the nick of time, kissing Eve again. The disruption to her circuits forces Mary to relinquish control, but Will hears Mary's voice in Eve's mind. The gang are left with a burning question - could Mary be alive?.</desc>

Today our pesky pranksters are Dukafundis (Markus and Ellysa) and 'Very Intelligent Pranksters' (Evan and Ashazia) who team up with digital effects wizard Hassan Aziz and SFX specialists Marc Reichel and Andy Antoine to stage the biggest and best PUBLIC PRANKS on an unsuspecting public. The teams take over a bowling alley and it's all hands on deck to rig the hidden cameras and special effects required to bring our Pranksters' ideas to life. But which team will impress our prank-loving panel of 'Ranksters' to win the chance to stage a mind blowing MEGA PRANK on a 'target' of their choice? It's strike three for the targets when Markus and Ellysa's 'Haunted Alley' dukes it out with Evan and Ashazia's 'Hotdog Bowler'. Ranksters ... the choice is yours. For the winning team, the effectors have planned the ultimate MEGA PRANK at a car wash featuring a dirty car, a nervous driver and a meteor shower! Our 'target' may be able to avoid the meteor but will mom's car be able to do the same? One thing's for sure, this explosively entertaining mega prank strikes comedy gold!.</desc>
