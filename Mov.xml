    <desc lang="en">Ever fancied being a Pilot? Join our rookies Akshita and Sam along with presenter Alex Riley as they take off into the world of aviation. Our aspiring young aircrew get their first opportunity to actually fly a plane as they are catapulted into the skies high above the peak district in a glider. They then head for Manchester to meet an airline pilot who shows them just what is needed to fly a passenger jet and lets them fly a professional simulator as used to train real pilots! Finally what they have always dreamed of happens - they take to the skies in a small aircraft with mentor Tony who puts them through their paces handling a twin engine plane. And then they get to fly it themselves, actually taking control of the plane high above the ground! Impressive!</desc>

Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line(n)</desc>

Chickedy and Chick run along the rod to the very end. Toodloo runs along the rod and jumps to join Chickedy and Chick. This causes the rod to spring up sending them flying! The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line(n)</desc>
