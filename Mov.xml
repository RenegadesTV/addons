    <sub-title lang="en">Caribbean</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The singer embarks on a series of ocean odysseys, and while she is no stranger to the open sea, having found fame on 1998 BBC TV documentary The Cruise, the mega-cruiser she boards is a far cry from the 600-passenger vessel she is used to. In the opening edition, she and her fellow passengers stop off in Nassau in the Bahamas, where Jane finds solace in the state's oldest baptist church, and St Martin, where she seeks an intimate underwater audience with a host of sharks. Back on board, Jane is startled by the scale of everything - from the food and activities to the sheer number of people.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Lilliputian lope round the Inner Hebrides puts Jane in touch with her Scottish roots, as alongside just six other passengers the singer embarks on what is easily her smallest ever cruise. Jane enjoys unseasonably cloudless skies and sparkling seas as the route takes in the puffin-packed Treshnish Islands and Fingal's Cave on Staffa, the mythic rock formation that famously inspired Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture. The excursion is rounded off with some traditional trappings, from ceilidhs and weaving to haggis-making.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jay is off tending to her mother (who broke her leg) and Michael is in charge at home. The kids don't like it. "You miss your mommy a lot, don't you?" he commiserates with Kady. So he tries to cheer her up with fanciful tales about her birth (one of which features a cameo by Shaquille O'Neal). Meanwhile, Jr.'s new "friends" aren't being very friendly, and Claire's friend Charmaine (Raven-Symone) has become a household fixture. Jennifer Freeman takes over the role of Claire.

And it means that Claire may talk on the telephone as long as she likes, as long as she uses the pay phone Michael has installed. Keisha: Natashia Williams. (repeat).(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Pond Life</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Mildred's having fun jumping high into the air with Enid - using pirated magic to make the grass bouncy. Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Great Wizard's Visit</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Everyone's surprised to hear the Great Wizard is making an unexpected visit to Cackle's Academy. He's had a tip off that the school is going rapidly downhill and it looks like non-magical Mildred is at the heart of the problems. Miss Cackle (really Agatha) refuses to expel Mildred and waxes lyrical about her. The Great Wizard insists that Mildred should perform a magical display to prove herself. Creative Mildred conducts a magical potions choir, but it ends in disaster leaving Miss Cackle on thin ice. To everyone's surprise, Miss Cackle (Agatha) makes Mildred lead a broomstick display. Mildred works out that Agatha is impersonating Miss Cackle but has to go ahead with the display - not realising Ethel had put a spell on the broomstick. Mildred begs Maud to find the real Miss Cackle, so while Mildred and Enid are in peril in the air, Maud battles her way up to Miss Cackle's room to find her under an entrancement spell. Just as Mildred and Enid start to plummet, the real Miss Cackle saves them. The Great Wizard has to eat his words - Mildred is a good witch and deserves her place in the school.</desc>

Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred.(n)</desc>
