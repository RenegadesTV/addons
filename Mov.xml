Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę</desc>

Przez kilka miesięcy kamera towarzyszy lekarzom oraz pacjentom jednego z największych szpitali publicznych. Rejestruje chwile od momentu diagnozy poprzez przygotowania do operacji, sam zabieg aż do efektu leczenia. W programie nie zabraknie także autentycznych emocji: obawy, cierpienia, ulgi czy radości. 30-letnia Marlena to atrakcyjna młoda kobieta, która cierpi na tzw. syndrom habsburski. Jej żuchwa jest nienaturalnie wysunięta do przodu, co od wielu lat jest źródłem kompleksów i bólu</desc>

Kamery towarzyszą pacjentom podczas kolejnych etapów leczenia. Operacje przeprowadza pionier chirurgicznego leczenia otyłości w Polsce, prof. dr hab. Krzysztof Paśnik. Decyzja o zabiegu nie była łatwa. Wszystkim towarzyszył silny strach, z jednej strony związany z samym przebiegiem operacji, a z drugiej - z własnym słabościami i obawami przez "nowym" życiem. W proces leczenia włączono psychologa, dietetyka i trenera personalnego. Wsparciem dla pacjentów jest Artur, uczestnik pierwszej edycji serialu "Sala operacyjna", który pokonał nadwagę</desc>

What exactly does a head teacher do all day? Taylor Jay and Charlie find out as they investigate on a mission to write and photograph a report for the school website. They are both shocked to discover that their headteacher, Mr French, starts his school day at 6am and he expects Taylor Jay and Charlie to turn up at the same time so they can experience for themselves the long hours which are his routine. It isn't long before Taylor Jay is yawning her way through her classes!.</desc>
