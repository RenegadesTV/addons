    <desc lang="en">This remake of Norman Jewison's 1975 sci-fi actioner set in 2005 follows the exploits of a star player (Chris Klein) in an extremely violent sport. James Caan starred in the original. This movie marks the second time filmmaker John McTiernan remade a picture directed by Norman Jewison; the first was "The Thomas Crown Affair" in 1999. Rapper LL Cool J costars as Klein's teammate and friend; and colorful rock star Pink has a cameo. (cc).</desc>
