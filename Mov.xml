But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.(n)</desc>

Melody imagines two dinosaurs having a race. Initially the smaller dinosaur is winning, but stops to take a rest. The larger dinosaur plods on slowly but surely and wins the race. Melody's verdict is that slow is best.(n)</desc>
