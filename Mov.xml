Rachel nie może więc pominąć tak ważnego zjawiska związanego z kulinariami jak jedzenie w drodze. Prowadząca odwiedzi nietypową restaurację, która mieści się w starym wagonie metra, przygotuje też ciepły posiłek dla głodnych taksówkarzy. Po powrocie do domu Rachel poda przepis na lunch dla zapracowanych. Co ważne, wszystkie dania bez problemu zabierzemy ze sobą do metra(n)</desc>

Kamera odwiedzi rodzinne miasto kucharki - Bardi w północnych Włoszech. Poznamy jej kuzyna, Paolo, mistrza pieczenia. Jego numer popisowy to złocista tarta z ziemniakami i szpinakiem. Rodzina już od stu lat przekazuje ten przepis z pokolenia na pokolenie. Drugim gościem programu będzie Marina, której rodzina prowadzi w regionie Emilia Romagna kilka wytwórni parmezanu. W Walii Michela przygotuje nidi - zapiekane pod parmezanem "gniazdka" z ciasta naleśnikowego z klasycznym sosem pomidorowym, warzywami, szynką i ricottą. Przyrządzi też sos olio, aglio e peperoncino, który poda z bezglutenową wersją tagliatelle(n)</desc>

Tymczasem Grayson Kent (Jackson Hurst) zaczyna domyślać się, kim Jane jest naprawdę. Myśl o tym, że koleżanka z pracy to jego ukochana Deb, dręczy go i prowokuje wiele tragikomicznych sytuacji. W końcu, w dzień ślubu Jane, mężczyzna postanawia ujawnić swoje uczucia do niej. W tym sezonie prawniczka otrzymuje również nowego anioła stróża - Freda zastąpi w tej roli Luke (Carter MacIntyre)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Serial przenosi widzów w lata 40. XX w. do kanadyjskiej fabryki amunicji "Victory Munitions". Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Mąż Olivii, Bryan porzucił ją, gdy stał się bardzo bogaty. Przed ślubem podpisali intercyzę, więc po oficjalnym rozstaniu siostra Owena może liczyć jedynie na ułamek majątku. Olivia wyznaje, że właściwie nie chce rozwodu, ale czuje się głęboko zraniona, bo Bryan zdradza ją z komputerową aplikacją o wyglądzie blond piękności. Kim musi udowodnić w sądzie, że mężczyzna żyje w wirtualnej rzeczywistości. Z kolei klientką Jane zostaje Rita Curtis, była pracownica supermarketu, która uważa, że została bezpodstawnie zwolniona. Prawniczka czuje, że łączy ją z tą kobietą znacznie więcej, niż mogłoby się wydawać na pierwszy rzut oka. Tymczasem Grayston pracuje nad umową spółki Stacy i Nikki. Odkrywa, że LePree nie jest osobą, za którą się podaje. Jane nie chce, by jej przyjaciółka powierzyła oszustce oszczędności swojego życia(n)</desc>

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej.

Badania wykazały, że chłopak miał napad padaczki spowodowany groźnym naczyniakiem wywierającym nacisk na jego mózg. Zdaniem lekarzy w tym przypadku najskuteczniejszy będzie zabieg przeprowadzany bez rozcinania czaszki pacjenta. Operator dociera specjalnym mikrocewnikiem do naczyniaka i za pomocą kleju odcina go od układu krwionośnego. Ze względu na rozmiar zmiany leczenie przebiega stopniowo, dlatego to już trzecia operacja, której zostanie poddany Michał(n)</desc>

Soon all the Furchesters are jumping and chanting 'Furball!' too. Elmo asks why they are all shouting 'Furball' and Furgus says that it's because the Furball has arrived, it's the best game ever, whenever he turns up at the hotel they all play a game of 'Furball', he's very excited and goes to get his Furball equipment bag and everything is there except his Furball shoes. Furgus and Funella go to look for his shoes and tell Phoebe and Elmo to keep an eye on the Furball and not let him out of their sight. Just at that moment, the Furball disappears, only for them to spot him up on the balcony, they're soon chasing him all over the hotel. Phoebe decides to look in her Dad's Furball bag and finds a Furball net, they hear boinging and get ready to pounce, but they catch a very suspicious looking rabbit instead. Cookie Monster then comes along and tells them to use Furball bait - a cookie! They put the cookie in the Furball net and wait, but instead of catching a Furball they catch Cookie Monster instead, with which he remembers that cookies are Cookie Monster bait, not Furball bait(n)</desc>
