    <desc lang="en">M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed this atmospheric, suspenseful story about a disillusioned ex-minister (Mel Gibson) who discovers mysterious crop circles on his farm. Look for Shyamalan appearing in a cameo à la Alfred Hitchcock. The director cited Hitchcock's “The Birds” as one of the films that influenced this one. He also gives nods to “Night of the Living Dead” and “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” (cc)(n)</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy.

    <desc lang="pl">Trzeba odzyskać ważne dokumenty trzymane w pilnie strzeżonej willi na Krymie. Zleceniodawca chciał powierzyć to zadanie dwóm dostawcom: jednym z nich miał być Bernard Dassin, drugim - Frank. Ten ostatni, kierowany dumą i troską o własne bezpieczeństwo, nie przyjmuje oferty. Zmienia jednak zdanie, kiedy klient obwieszcza, że sprawa jest powiązana z zaginięciem ukochanej Franka. Istnieją dowody na to, że w jej zniknięcie był zamieszany minister, który obecnie przebywa właśnie na Półwyspie Krymskim. W tej sytuacji Frank jest zmuszony połączyć siły z Dassinem i jego pomocnikiem, Julesem Faroux. Dostawca nie wierzy w lojalność swoich nowych wspólników(n)</desc>

W programie panie, które niezbyt dobrze radzą sobie z prowadzeniem auta zasiądą na miejscu kierowcy. Pasażerami, a jednocześnie instruktorami będą... ich partnerzy. Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą. Emocji na pewno nie zabraknie</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Francuski serial kryminalny opowiadający o pracy w wydziale paryskiej policji, który specjalizuje się w poszukiwaniu sprawców morderstw. Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"</desc>

Zleceniodawca chciał powierzyć to zadanie dwóm dostawcom: jednym z nich miał być Bernard Dassin, drugim - Frank. Ten ostatni, kierowany dumą i troską o własne bezpieczeństwo, nie przyjmuje oferty. Zmienia jednak zdanie, kiedy klient obwieszcza, że sprawa jest powiązana z zaginięciem ukochanej Franka. Istnieją dowody na to, że w jej zniknięcie był zamieszany minister, który obecnie przebywa właśnie na Półwyspie Krymskim. W tej sytuacji Frank jest zmuszony połączyć siły z Dassinem i jego pomocnikiem, Julesem Faroux. Dostawca nie wierzy w lojalność swoich nowych wspólników(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Maddie is out and about exploring different ways to travel. She visits an airfield and uses a special camera to find out how the rotor works to help make a helicopter fly. An animation shows how changing the angle of the rotor blades makes the helicopter go forwards and backwards. Next, Maddie visits a workshop to see how a tricycle is constructed from a big box of parts and to see how the tricycle can be adapted to suit a user's needs(n)</desc>
