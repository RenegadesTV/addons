Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase ma złamane serce, kilka kilogramów nadwagi i nadzieję na szczęśliwą odmianę losu. Na razie porzucona przez niewiernego narzeczonego wraca do rodzinnego domu, gdzie musi wysłuchiwać narzekań matki, Barbary, która chętnie widziałaby ją na ślubnym ołtarzu. Lekarka ze zmiennym szczęściem walczy też ze swoją największą namiętnością - jedzeniem. Za radą ojca Gretchen poświęca się robieniu kariery. W pracy nieoczekiwanie wikła się w miłosny trójkąt z dwoma kolegami ze szpitalnego oddziału - dawnym znajomym ze szkoły, ordynatorem Markiem Meierem i wrażliwym ginekologiem doktorem Mehdim Kaanem. Odtąd operacje, diety i dwaj interesujący mężczyźni stanowią codzienność doktor Haase(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zbliża się rocznica ślubu rodziców Gretchen. Haase ma mało czasu, by znaleźć partnera na tę uroczystość. Przyjaciółka umawia ją na randkę w ciemno, ale kandydat okazuje się niezbyt interesujący, a Gretchen nie dość zdesperowana, by zrezygnować z poszukiwań lepszej partii. Chętnie zaprosiłaby doktora Meiera, ale on upodobał ją sobie na obiekt swoich żartów, z kolei doktor Kaan wydaje się ignorować jej osobę. Na domiar złego na oddział trafia była partnerka ordynatora, Nina, która uległa nieszczęśliwemu wypadkowi. Dzięki temu Gretchen poznaje kilka ważnych szczegółów z życia swojego dawnego ukochanego. Tego samego dnia lekarka bierze udział w swojej pierwszej operacji, której obiektem jest męskie przyrodzenie(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Francuski serial kryminalny opowiadający o pracy w wydziale paryskiej policji, który specjalizuje się w poszukiwaniu sprawców morderstw. Do zespołu dołącza utalentowana psycholog Chloé Saint-Laurent (Odile Vuillemin), traktowana na początku z rezerwą przez funkcjonariuszy. Szybko jednak okazuje się, że ta niepozorna młoda kobieta jest znakomitym profilerem. Dzięki niezwykłej wrażliwości wnika w umysły morderców i ich ofiar. Zdolność ta sprawia, że Chloé bardzo skutecznie pomaga policji. Jej pierwsza sprawa dotyczy morderstwa dziewczyny, która została oszpecona. W tych okolicznościach Saint-Laurent poznaje swojego nowego współpracownika, komendanta Matthieu Péraca (Guillaume Cramoisan)... Odile Vuillemin, choć wcześniej wystąpiła w kilku rodzimych produkcjach, prawdziwą popularność zdobyła dopiero dzięki świetnej roli Chloé w serialu "Profil"(n)</desc>
