    <desc lang="pl">Tobi Powell (Patrick Stewart) pracuje w prestiżowej nowojorskiej szkole baletowej. Pewnego dnia nauczyciel zostaje poproszony o udzielenie wywiadu Lisie (Carla Gugino) i Mike'owi (Matthew Lillard), którzy piszą rozprawę poświęconą historii tańca. W rzeczywistości rozmowa jest tylko pretekstem, aby przeprowadzić prywatne śledztwo. Mike przypuszcza bowiem, że pedagog może być jego biologicznym rodzicem. Nie tylko wypytuje go o szczegóły z życia osobistego, ale i pobiera próbkę DNA. Wynik testu na ojcostwo okazuje się jednak sporym zaskoczeniem... Scenariusz filmu powstał na podstawie sztuki granej na Broadwayu. W roli głównej wystąpił Patrick Stewart, niezapomniany kapitan Jean-Luc Picard z serii "Star Trek"(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Nauczyciel tańca</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Tobi Powell (Patrick Stewart) pracuje w prestiżowej nowojorskiej szkole baletowej. Pewnego dnia nauczyciel zostaje poproszony o udzielenie wywiadu Lisie (Carla Gugino) i Mike'owi (Matthew Lillard), którzy piszą rozprawę poświęconą historii tańca. W rzeczywistości rozmowa jest tylko pretekstem, aby przeprowadzić prywatne śledztwo. Mike przypuszcza bowiem, że pedagog może być jego biologicznym rodzicem. Nie tylko wypytuje go o szczegóły z życia osobistego, ale i pobiera próbkę DNA. Wynik testu na ojcostwo okazuje się jednak sporym zaskoczeniem... Scenariusz filmu powstał na podstawie sztuki granej na Broadwayu. W roli głównej wystąpił Patrick Stewart, niezapomniany kapitan Jean-Luc Picard z serii "Star Trek"(n)</desc>

With a party to organise the gang get to work - Matilda's brother Jack and sisters Megan and Holly take shopping to another level as they speed along the river Thames on a high-performance rib to pick up supplies. Matilda's in charge of the party food: build your own spicy sausage pitta bread sandwiches with zingy yoghurt sauce and popcorn cakes. The popcorn cakes idea came from Scarlet, a Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch viewer who emailed it to Matilda's Food Blog. Great food, friends and fun, and the party finishing with a bang when the guys play an explosive game with a watermelon - parties don't get much better!.(n)</desc>

Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on.

Determined to save his son, Nick lays aside his initial suspicions when Katherine appears with a high-tech solution. Will comes round and, despite a nano-hangover, seems well. But, as Nick knows, he is not out of danger yet - Katherine has supplied only a temporary fix. Heeding Nick's warning, Eve tracks down Peterson with Abe in tow. At his old address, they are met by the new resident, Mr Roberts, who denies knowing the whereabouts of Mr Peterson, though Eve's suspicions are alerted when she scans a Calimov pass in the hallway. With Nick taking Will into Calimov, Eve decides it's best to be by his side, leaving Abe to investigate alone. The nano charge has had a surprising effect on Will; Lily and Eve are bemused as he relays abstract scientific theorems. As part of his ongoing therapy, Katherine administers another charge, but this time Will's body has an adverse reaction, causing him to freeze. When Mr Roberts appears, with nanotech, it becomes clear there is a deeper connection between him and Peterson. He stabilises Will, and tries to exit, but Eve is on to him. Though at first he denies he is her father, Eve has guessed the truth. Katherine confirms his identity, and claims to have brought him back with the sole purpose of saving Will. Back at Eden Farm, meanwhile, Abe discovers what Peterson has really been hiding: Rebecca, confined in his makeshift lab, supplying him with nanobots to find the cure for Will. Despite Abe's concern, she swears him to silence. But can Abe keep quiet?.(n)</desc>

Iona and grandad James dress up in clothes from the time known as the Highland Clearances. They learn about a boy called Lachlan and why he, and many other families, had to leave their homes and move to a new country. Together they discover what life was like for Lachlan in Scotland - where he would live, the language he spoke, the food he would have eaten and the jobs he would do to help his family. Iona and grandad James then visit an American township to see how different Lachlan's new life in America would have been and they try their hand at panning for gold.(n)</desc>
