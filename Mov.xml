    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Do szpitala trafia matka Meiera. Cierpi na wrzody żołądka. Gretchen przenosi się w świat fantazji. Snuje rozważania na temat powieści 'Dr. Rogelt' i swojej roli w przedstawionej tam historii miłosnej</desc>

W towarzystwie jednego z nich Haase wybierze się do Las Vegas, nie wiadomo jednak, czy zamierza tam spróbować szczęścia w kasynie czy wziąć szybki ślub. Gabi dokona przerażającego odkrycia, które jest związane z mężczyzną o imieniu Kalle.

    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Relacje Haase z mężczyznami przypominają rozgrywki sportowe, łącznie z wymianą koszulek. Tym razem przeciwników jest trzech. Przyjaciółka Gina stawia Haase tarota, by odkryć przed nią przyszłość(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Doktor Gretchen Haase wywołuje chaos nie tylko na oddziale chirurgicznym, lecz przede wszystkim w sercach swoich kolegów. Nigdy nie aspirowała do roli bogini. Jest zwykłą dziewczyną, która robi karierę medyczną i musi walczyć z porywami serca. Jej osobowość i urok osobisty przyciąga do niej mężczyzn jak magnes. Nie dane było Gretchen cieszyć się miesiącem miodowym w ramionach męża. Wszyscy obecni w kościele trafiają na kwarantannę z powodu epidemii.

    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Do szpitala trafia matka Meiera. Cierpi na wrzody żołądka. Gretchen przenosi się w świat fantazji. Snuje rozważania na temat powieści 'Dr. Rogelt' i swojej roli w przedstawionej tam historii miłosnej</desc>

W towarzystwie jednego z nich Haase wybierze się do Las Vegas, nie wiadomo jednak, czy zamierza tam spróbować szczęścia w kasynie czy wziąć szybki ślub. Gabi dokona przerażającego odkrycia, które jest związane z mężczyzną o imieniu Kalle. Nie zabraknie seksu, trzech propozycji małżeństwa, tajemniczej plantacji marihuany - ale niestety nie oznacza to szczęśliwego zakończenia</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Z pamiętnika lekarki (odc. 16)</title>
    <desc lang="pl">"Z pamiętnika lekarki" powraca! To kolejna odsłona przygód doktor Gretchen Haase, uwikłanej w miłosną relację z dwoma kolegami po fachu. W ośmiu nowych odcinkach lekarka znów będzie starała się trzymać emocje na wodzy oraz walczyć z pokusami ciała i ducha. Czas pokaże, czy spragniona uczuć kobieta znajdzie swoją bratnią duszę, a przy okazji zgubi kilka zbędnych kilogramów. Relacje Haase z mężczyznami przypominają rozgrywki sportowe, łącznie z wymianą koszulek. Tym razem przeciwników jest trzech. Przyjaciółka Gina stawia Haase tarota, by odkryć przed nią przyszłość</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Salford Curse.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Jas decides to follow in her dad's footsteps and try out for the junior hockey team. Mr Salford was a legendary hockey goalie in his time at the school. When the try-outs are cancelled due to the coach not being available, Mr Salford steps in and offers his services as coach. Mrs Griggs is horrified - she could do without the chaos he inevitably brings with him - but he won't take no for an answer. Jas and her father are really superstitious and when things start going wrong Jas thinks she's jinxed, and then that she's passed on the jinx to her dad. When she's not picked as goalie for the team Jas is actually relieved - it must mean she's still jinxed and hasn't passed on the jinx to her dad. Eventually Jas does need to play in goal, but when she saves a crucial penalty she and her dad are delighted to realise they are not jinxed after all, just accident-prone! Meanwhile, Martha &amp; Ollie get paranoid that Cassie &amp; Maxwell are usurping them. They've taken over their favourite nook in the library and when they turn up to do their regular security check on Mrs Rennison's computer Cassie and Maxwell have already been there and done it. They decide they've got to get their own back and they sabotage a fizzy drinks maker Cassie and Maxwell have created to provide refreshments at the hockey match. They turn up the CO2 dial and everyone gets very burpy! Lily is feeling abandoned by her friends - they all seem too busy to hang out with her. Matt advises her that a big gesture could do the trick. When she unfurls a giant banner during the hockey match declaring her admiration for her friends it's really embarrassing. It does prompt Martha and Ollie to do the right thing, though, and confess to Cassie and Maxwell that they sabotaged their fizzy drinks machine and does inspire Jas to save that crucial penalty(n)</desc>

Dr Ranj shows her an x-ray of her fractured radius. She is going to have her plaster cast replaced with a fibre glass cast. Dr Ranj cuts off the plaster cast. Petal thinks her arm is thin and smelly but this is because she hasn't been able to wash it. Dr Ranj says Petal can choose the colour of her new cast. Petal picks her favourite colour, purple. Dr Ranj puts the new cast on Petal. She loves it and sings a song with Dr Ranj about taking care of your bones and wearing a cast. Petal then gets a special sticker for having being so good during her visit(n)</desc>
