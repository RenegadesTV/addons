    <desc lang="en">Londyn to międzynarodowa stolica mody. W stylu prezentowanym przez mieszkańców tego miasta liczy się pomysłowość i niekonwencjonalne rozwiązania. Przy czym dobry wygląd nie ma związku tu z zasobnością portfela. Główne składniki charakteryzujące londyńską modę Rachel zastosuje w kuchni przy przyrządzaniu klasycznego deseru i smacznej sałatki. Na koniec przekształci zwyczajne danie z makaronu w posiłek będący popisem kunsztu kulinarnego.(n)</desc>

Poważnie traktuje zalecenia prof. Paśnika. Chodzi na basem i ćwiczy. Z kolei Emil i jego mama wracają do szpitala. Waga Eli utrzymuje się na tym samym poziomie, a jej syn nareszcie schudł. Ich szczęście trwa jednak krótko. Przy badaniach kontrolnych okazuje się, że Ela ma problemy kardiologiczne, a wyniki krwi Emila są bardzo złe. Ich operacje znów stoją pod znakiem zapytania. Karolina pojawia się w szpitalu. Niestety, okazuje się, że przytyła. Ma tylko kilka tygodni na przygotowanie się do zabiegu(n).(n)</desc>

Na koniec przekształci zwyczajne danie z makaronu w posiłek będący popisem kunsztu kulinarnego.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Of all the trees at Earth Mama's nursery, little Douglas fir tree Albert has the biggest ambition. He hopes to one day be the star of the show as the Christmas tree sitting at the heart of Empire City. As the festive season approaches, Albert set his mind to helping all the other plants at the nursery into the Christmas spirit. However, when a city-wide news bulletin announces the search for this year's tree, Albert spots a chance to live his dream, and sets out on a journey with help from his friends Maisie, a persistently positive palm tree, and Gene, a blisteringly honest weed. Festive animated adventure, with the voices of Bobby Moynihan, Sasheer Zamata and Judah Friedlander.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Of all the trees at Earth Mama's nursery, little Douglas fir tree Albert has the biggest ambition. He hopes to one day be the star of the show as the Christmas tree sitting at the heart of Empire City. As the festive season approaches, Albert set his mind to helping all the other plants at the nursery into the Christmas spirit. However, when a city-wide news bulletin announces the search for this year's tree, Albert spots a chance to live his dream, and sets out on a journey with help from his friends Maisie, a persistently positive palm tree, and Gene, a blisteringly honest weed. Festive animated adventure, with the voices of Bobby Moynihan, Sasheer Zamata and Judah Friedlander.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Family comedy adapted from David Walliams' children's book about 12-year-old Dennis, an ordinary boy who lives in an ordinary town - but somehow feels different from everyone else. A chance sighting in a fashion magazine introduces him to a whole new world of colour and creativity. But can a boy really wear a dress - and what will his headmaster, dad and friends in the football team think if they find out? Billy Kennedy stars as Dennis, with a supporting cast including Jennifer Saunders, Tim McInnerny, Meera Syal, Steve Speirs, Felicity Montagu, James Buckley and Walliams himself, with a cameo appearance by supermodel Kate Moss.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our five spoilt kids head next to a thriving British textiles factory in the heart of the midlands, Leicester. The busy factory the kids set to work in makes fashion clothes for British high street names and UK supermarkets and so the work has to be done to a very high standard. Plus, as the factory is competing against cheap imports from China the targets here are very strict - everything has to be done in silence, at speed and with no compromise on quality. How will our kids cope when they are put to work on a real stitching line reporting to the strict factory boss Mick who makes sure his workers deliver quality work at all times? And when one of the team shows real promise, how do those who are lagging behind react? Presented by Stacey Dooley(n).(n)</desc>

Big Bird realises he's forgotten to tell Santa that he's staying at The Furchester Hotel for Christmas and is worried that Santa won't know where to deliver his presents. Elmo and the other guests haven't told Santa either and become really worried. Will Santa know where to deliver their presents? It's too late to get a letter to the North Pole, so the Furchesters try to distract all the guests with their Christmas activities. However, every mention of Santa makes everyone worried again, they don't finish any of the activities they started. And Phoebe is disappointed that she can't enjoy her Christmas the way the Furchesters planned it. With the help of Harvey P Dull, Elmo and Big Bird realise there's more to Christmas than presents, and that sharing traditions and celebrating together is what makes Christmas so special(n).(n)</desc>
