Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch has built his own rival Grim Academy dome on the side of a large, steep hill. He has uprooted trees in order to make room for his Grimdome, but without the roots of trees to hold the soil together the heavy rainfall starts a mudslide down the side of the hill! Mudslides are very powerful and can destroy anything in their path. Glitch and his cadets need rescuing before they are washed away down the hill.</desc>

Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch has built his own rival Grim Academy dome on the side of a large, steep hill. He has uprooted trees in order to make room for his Grimdome, but without the roots of trees to hold the soil together the heavy rainfall starts a mudslide down the side of the hill! Mudslides are very powerful and can destroy anything in their path. Glitch and his cadets need rescuing before they are washed away down the hill.</desc>
