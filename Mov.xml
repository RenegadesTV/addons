    <desc lang="en">Twigs needs to fill the last three spaces in his Bumper Book of Bark so he can wish for something amazing, but a Treemite is also after the bark. They tussle over whizz bark and tumble bark and then Twigs grabs some sparkle bark from the Treemite's giant bark ball causing it to roll after them and threaten Ariela's Ranch. Tom manages to avert disaster but the ball is destroyed in the process. When they find out it was the Treemite's nest they decide to help them find a new home - but how?
