Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu</desc>

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

Dziewczyna ma za sobą niechlubną przeszłość związaną z narkotykami, przemytem i udziałem w grupie przestępczej. Kaśka zatrzymuje się u swojej siostry Marty (Orina Krajewska), która wiedzie ustabilizowane życie singielki pracującej w korporacji. Zawierają one umowę: Kaśka przysięga, że nigdy nie wróci do więzienia, a Marta ma jej w tym pomóc. Droga do zwykłego życia nie będzie jednak łatwa... Scenariusz przypominającego dokument filmu "Siostry" w reżyserii Leszka Wejcmana powstał przy udziale więźniarek. Zdjęcia zrealizowano w Warszawie, m.in. w areszcie na Olszynce Grochowskiej i komisariacie przy ul. Jagiellońskiej.

Każda para będzie miała trzy dni na uzupełnienie braków i dogłębne poznanie techniki jazdy samochodem. Nie zawsze będzie różowo - widzowie będą świadkami wybuchów złości, łez porażki i słownych potyczek. Trudy nauki wydobędą bowiem z bohaterów prawdziwe uczucia, które żywią oni swoich połówek. Ale na tym nie koniec. Każda para przejdzie dodatkowo test końcowy. Uczestnicy, którzy najlepiej poradzą sobie z zadaniem wyjadą z programu z atrakcyjną nagrodą.

Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej.

Opowiada o życiu czterech pracownic, które mimo czasu wojny nie rezygnują z marzeń i planów na przyszłość. Lorna (Meg Tilly) jako najbardziej doświadczona odpowiada za koleżanki pracujące na hali. Gladys (Jodi Balfour) pochodzi z zamożnej rodziny, dlatego trudno jej zdobyć akceptację innych dziewcząt. Betty (Ali Liebert) prowadzi natomiast kampanię propagandową. Jej odwaga i nieustępliwość to jednak tylko pozory, ponieważ w głębi duszy skrywa wielkie obawy z powodu odmiennej orientacji seksualnej. Z kolei Kate (Charlotte Hegele) walczy z nieśmiałością i skrycie podkochuje się w swoim przyjacielu(n)</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Siostry</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Niebanalna historia dwóch sióstr, których życie potoczyło się w różnych kierunkach. Kaśka Czajkowska (Marie Carrour) po dwuletnim pobycie w więzieniu wychodzi na wolność. Dziewczyna ma za sobą niechlubną przeszłość związaną z narkotykami, przemytem i udziałem w grupie przestępczej. Kaśka zatrzymuje się u swojej siostry Marty (Orina Krajewska), która wiedzie ustabilizowane życie singielki pracującej w korporacji. Zawierają one umowę: Kaśka przysięga, że nigdy nie wróci do więzienia, a Marta ma jej w tym pomóc. Droga do zwykłego życia nie będzie jednak łatwa... Scenariusz przypominającego dokument filmu "Siostry" w reżyserii Leszka Wejcmana powstał przy udziale więźniarek. Zdjęcia zrealizowano w Warszawie, m.in. w areszcie na Olszynce Grochowskiej i komisariacie przy ul. Jagiellońskiej. Jedną z głównych ról zagrała Orina Krajewska, utalentowana córka Małgorzaty Braunek(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="pl">Jerzy Kryszak</sub-title>
    <desc lang="pl">W programie wystąpią najlepsi rodzimi specjaliści od dobrego humoru, m.in. Formacja Chatelet, Łowcy.B, Koń Polski, Kabaret pod Wyrwigroszem, Elita, Kabaret Skeczów Męczących i grupa Nowaki. Pojawią się liczni goście, a także sceniczne osobowości - Krzysztof Piasecki, Tomasz Jachimek, Jerzy Kryszak, Katarzyna Pakosińska i Andrzej Grabowski. Jerzy Kryszak to jeden z najbardziej rozpoznawalnych komików. Słynie z umiejętności parodiowania znanych osób. Jego występy to świetna zabawa, a jednocześnie błyskotliwy komentarz rzeczywistości(n)</desc>
