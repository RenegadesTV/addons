When the local sheriff brings in a body found in the basement of a home, it seems like just another open-and-shut case.

    <title lang="en">Alone in Berlin</title>
    <desc lang="en">Otto and Anna Quangel (Brendan Gleeson &amp; Emma Thompson) are a working-class husband and wife doing their best to ride out the war in Berlin in 1940. When their son is killed fighting on the frontlines however, everything changes. They begin pouring their rage and grief into postcards emblazoned with anti-Nazi slogans, risking everything to get their messages of protest across the city. This seemingly small act of subversion rattles the regime, including a police inspector (Daniel Brühl) who will not rest until the culprits have been caught.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's New Clothes</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ingenious game of "what if" lies at the heart of this gentle comedy/fantasy directed by Alan Taylor. In this alternative take on history, Napoleon (Ian Holm in a dual role) escapes exile on St. Helena when he and his supporters convince a minor deck-hand to double for him in captivity. The emperor will return to France, the ruse will be revealed, and Napoleon will return to power. Or that's the plan. Alas, it seems captivity has its allures and Bonaparte's doppelganger begins to enjoy his new persona. "Delightful" - "Los Angeles Times.".</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the 1860's, Hugh Crain finances the construction of Hill House, then dies an unexplained death. Tales circulate that the mansion is haunted by evil spirits. 130 years later, Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson), long fascinated by the Hill House legend, brings three people there for what he tells them will be a study in sleep disorders. They're outwardly brave, but it soon becomes evident that Hill House's sinister reputation has all of them on edge. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson costar.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Little Divas: Tantrums &amp; Tiaras</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Light-hearted documentary shedding light on the lives of people whose extravagant tastes often leave their parents or significant others substantially out of pocket. These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiance as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary profiling a selection of pensioners who are determined to grow old disgracefully. Among those highlighted are fame-hungry 62-year-old Jane Buckle from Hungerford, who is on a mission to become as famous as Beyonce by performing a `granny rap' with Wu Tang Clan, and Brighton resident Lynn Ruth Miller, who - at 82 years of age - is thought to be the world's oldest burlesque artist. In Manchester, 72-year-old triple divorcee Sophia is on the hunt for a toy-boy, and Cambridge punk-granny Annalisa refuses to let approaching her 90th year slow her down.</desc>

A spin-off, `Joey,' featuring Matt LeBlanc's character, was slated to debut in the fall of 2004. (cc).(n)</desc>

Unfortunately it clashes with a rare comet sighting, which Martha and Ollie are desperate to experience. They have even been allowed to borrow the very precious school telescope for the evening. Ollie is smuggled in to Lily's house by Martha to watch secretly from the attic, with Martha planning to split her time between both events. After much chaos and confusion, and with the presence of Ollie in the house rumbled, a compromise is finally reached, where the girls all get to do both the make-over and watch the rare comet. At the end of the make-over session Martha and Jas are horrified to see Lily has transformed herself to look exactly like Greta in a bid to impress Matt. To spare Lily's feelings they pretend to like her new look, but are relieved the next day in school to see Lily returned to her normal, natural self. Lily has realised it's better to be yourself, rather than try and change who you are just to please others.</desc>

As David tries to write about his trains, he also tries to convince his friend Laila to take part too, but no matter how hard he tries, Laila remains determined not to participate. Eventually David, with Grandma Zainab's help, works out that Laila's problem isn't stage fright but more to do with her difficulties with reading. However, David is able to rely on Mali and their friends to find a solution that allows Laila to participate.(n)</desc>
