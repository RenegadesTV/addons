    <title lang="en">68 Kill</title>
    <desc lang="en">Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) has got one thing going for him: he's head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He's more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she's hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree.</desc>

Exploring her far-reaching impact, the directors focus on Houston's central dilemma: even though she had made millions of dollars and was recognized as having one of the greatest voices of all time, she still couldn't do what she wanted, either professionally or in her personal life.(c)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy wishes he had a cartoon, little brother who wants to play all the time. Not a big sister who gets mad at him. Nodding off, a dream bubble above his head shows Roy playing with Zip-a little, cartoon brother. When Roy wakes up, he is thrilled to find that Zip has hopped out of his dream and into reality. But things don't quite go according to plan! Roy steps out of his room to find an upturned laundry basket on the landing and clothes everywhere! In the kitchen, Zip wolfs down a cake, and out in the garden he creates a grass whirlwind over Bill's newly mowed lawn. While Roy cleans up Zip's mess with a rake, he tells Tristan all about his cartoon brother who escaped from his dream and is causing havoc. Roy realises that having a cartoon brother who wants to play all the time, might not always be such fun. Roy knows they have to get Zip back to Dreamland and wonders - What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, The Messer is wreaking havoc, until Wonder Roy puts a halt to his shenanigans by bringing in The Messer's mother, wisely working out that everyone gets homesick. Back in reality, Tristan and Roy work together to show Zip what he's missing in Dreamland? endless cakes and endless fun! Zip leaps onto Roy's bed and bounces into the dream bubble. Lesson learned, Roy tidies the bedroom for Becky. He finishes, just in the nick of time, as Becky arrives home with some cake to share with her favourite, little cartoon brother.</desc>

Roy tries to help with the snacks for Becky's movie night but a loud rumble of thunder makes him leap and sprawl across the ceiling! Bill and Maura explain that it's normal to be afraid of the storm and that they're perfectly safe, but when the lights go out, Roy whirls into a cartoon panic! He wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy and Finn discover Nighty Knight has cut the power to Toonville and is using his giant shadow to scare the inhabitants. The dynamic duo quickly reveal his trick and send him on his way. Back in reality, Roy is inspired to generate a cartoon light-bulb to keep the dark at bay. Then, when Becky's movie night is cancelled, Roy uses his stretchy skills to entertain everyone with a shadow puppet show. Even when the lights come back on, everyone agrees that they don't need a movie night - Roy is the only entertainment they need!(n)</desc>
