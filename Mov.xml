    <desc lang="en">One-off documentary exploring some of Britain's most bizarre parent-child relationships, where the mums and dads will do anything to look better than their kids. Those featured include 39-year-old Georgina, who was once a frumpy mum but has now followed daughter Kayla by becoming the image of a Barbie doll, complete with fake boobs and lips. Forty-five-year-old Paul is constantly muscling in on the action with his 18-year-old bodybuilder son Kyle, and former glamour model Charmaine loves flaunting what she has, much to the embarrassment of 14-year-old Yasmin. But when she decides to go back to modelling, how will her daughter react?.(c)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Maria Ellis chce rozwieść się z mężem Charlesem, gdyż czuje się przez niego zaniedbywana. Wkrótce odkrywa, że mężczyzna miał w innym mieście drugą... żonę, Emily Parcells. Dotąd obie kobiety nie wiedziały o swoim istnieniu. Teraz postanawiają razem wnieść do sądu sprawę przeciwko Charlesowi. Ich reprezentantką zostaje Jane. Na sali rozpraw okazuje się, że obrońcą oskarżanego o bigamię mężczyzny jest Tony Nicastro, były chłopak Bingum. Tymczasem Kim obawia się, że może być w ciąży. Mimo tego zgadza się reprezentować przed sądem przyjaciółkę, Caitlin Tanner. Chce ona odzyskać dziecko, które urodziła dla niej surogatka, Lana Dooley. Dziewczyna dostała pieniądze, a następnie porwała niemowlę z domu Caitlin. Kim podejrzewa, że za uprowadzeniem nie kryją się wcale rozbudzone uczucia macierzyńskie..(n)</desc>

Miasteczko Aleksandria leży na samej granicy konfliktu, który podzielił stany Północy i Południa. W mieszczącym się tam hotelu Mansion House powstaje szpital polowy założony przez okupujące miasto wojska Unii. To właśnie tam krzyżują się drogi dwóch wolontariuszek: stojącej po stronie Północy pielęgniarki Mary Phinney (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) oraz Emmy Green (Hannah James), słynącej z piękności zwolenniczki Konfederatów. Życiem mieszkańców Aleksandrii rządzą bezlitosny przypadek, nienawiść, wola przetrwania i - mimo wszystko - nadzieja(n)</desc>

Ma też lekką asymetrię lewej części twarzy i problemy ze wzrokiem. Wizja powikłań sprawiła, że uciekała przed decyzją o operacji przez kilka lat. Próbowała leczyć się przy pomocy medycyny naturalnej, a nawet jogi. Od pewnego czasu guz zaczął jednak rosnąć w zastraszającym tempie, co zmusiło Olgę do podjęcia decyzji o leczeniu. Uwierzyła, że dr Głowacki ze Szpitala Zachodniego w Grodzisku Mazowieckim może jej pomóc. Operacja, której podjął się specjalista jest bardzo ryzykowna i skomplikowana(n)</desc>

Dotąd obie kobiety nie wiedziały o swoim istnieniu. Teraz postanawiają razem wnieść do sądu sprawę przeciwko Charlesowi. Ich reprezentantką zostaje Jane. Na sali rozpraw okazuje się, że obrońcą oskarżanego o bigamię mężczyzny jest Tony Nicastro, były chłopak Bingum. Tymczasem Kim obawia się, że może być w ciąży. Mimo tego zgadza się reprezentować przed sądem przyjaciółkę, Caitlin Tanner. Chce ona odzyskać dziecko, które urodziła dla niej surogatka, Lana Dooley. Dziewczyna dostała pieniądze, a następnie porwała niemowlę z domu Caitlin. Kim podejrzewa, że za uprowadzeniem nie kryją się wcale rozbudzone uczucia macierzyńskie..(n)</desc>

Miasteczko Aleksandria leży na samej granicy konfliktu, który podzielił stany Północy i Południa. W mieszczącym się tam hotelu Mansion House powstaje szpital polowy założony przez okupujące miasto wojska Unii. To właśnie tam krzyżują się drogi dwóch wolontariuszek: stojącej po stronie Północy pielęgniarki Mary Phinney (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) oraz Emmy Green (Hannah James), słynącej z piękności zwolenniczki Konfederatów. Życiem mieszkańców Aleksandrii rządzą bezlitosny przypadek, nienawiść, wola przetrwania i - mimo wszystko - nadzieja(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">W głowie 38-letniej Olgi z Poznania coraz szybciej rozwija się guz, w wyniku czego przestała słyszeć na jedno ucho. Ma też lekką asymetrię lewej części twarzy i problemy ze wzrokiem. Wizja powikłań sprawiła, że uciekała przed decyzją o operacji przez kilka lat. Próbowała leczyć się przy pomocy medycyny naturalnej, a nawet jogi. Od pewnego czasu guz zaczął jednak rosnąć w zastraszającym tempie, co zmusiło Olgę do podjęcia decyzji o leczeniu. Uwierzyła, że dr Głowacki ze Szpitala Zachodniego w Grodzisku Mazowieckim może jej pomóc. Operacja, której podjął się specjalista jest bardzo ryzykowna i skomplikowana(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Twórcy serii w każdym odcinku przybliżają widzom gorączkowe ślubne przygotowania kolejnej pary narzeczonych. Zwłaszcza przyszłe panny młode są zdeterminowane, aby mieć idealny ślub. Dla wszystkich, którzy stają im na drodze są złośliwe, wymagające i egoistyczne. Aby zrealizować swój cel, są gotowe zapomnieć o skrupułach czy sentymentach. Wszystko bowiem ma być tak, jak to one sobie wymarzyły!(n)</desc>

Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.</desc>

Maud's getting fed up with Enid constantly distracting Mildred - Maud knows Mildred needs to knuckle down if she's going to stand a chance at the academy and can't bear the thought of losing her. Mildred receives a singing teddy from home and it makes her feel homesick. When Mildred looks to Maud for help in Miss Gullet's transformations class, Maud doesn't bail her out and Mildred turns Ethel into a pig instead of a mouse into frog. She doesn't even manage to turn Ethel back successfully - she still has a pig's snout! Mildred receives a harsh warning from Miss Hardbroom who threatens expulsion if she can't perform the spell correctly. Mildred feels fed up with all the rules of school and always being the worst witch. It's the final straw, she wants to go home. Drusilla intercepts her leaving, telling her that Maud and Enid are fighting. But it's a trick, and Mildred finds herself facing Ethel. As revenge for still having a pig snout, Ethel turns Mildred into a frog and throws her out of the window.</desc>

Sylvan is helping Dad to make pancakes for breakfast for the rest of the family before they all take a trip to a local flower garden to get some ideas for nature pictures. Back at home Sylvan uses the photos he took along with some things he collected to make a beautiful collage. After a busy day, it's time for Sylvan to head to bed - dressed as a superhero! Mum reads him one of his favourite stories before kissing him goodnight.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Funella has written the beginning to a new song to welcome guests into the Furchester Hotel. It's very very catchy. So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!.(n)</desc>

Trixie and Olly try out the types of food that sailors would have eaten, including some very hard ship's biscuits! Then, they discover why sailors had to be good at sewing. Together they visit a big ship just like the one Francis went on and find out all about the sorts of jobs a ship's boy had to do. Finally, they go looking for treasure!.(n)</desc>
