Miss Hardbroom is doggedly determined the school will perform brilliantly. Seeing Tabby is a distraction to Mildred (and pretty useless), Tabby is unceremoniously dismissed to the kitchens and Mildred is given a new cat called Ebony. Mildred is distraught, knowing Tabby won't cope as a mouser so Maud and Enid try to help Tabby, but they just make things worse! Miss Pentangle and her contestants arrive, and Miss Hardbroom is on edge. Ethel struggles to know how to act around male contestant, Zac. Mildred learns that Miss Hardbroom and Pentangle were school friends but fell out over a misunderstanding. Against the odds, the Cackle's team win the Spelling Bee. Miss Pentangle sees Mildred's potential and offers her a scholarship at her school. Mildred is flattered but realises she fits in best at Cackle's with her friends. Mildred pushes the two old friends back together so in return, Miss Hardbroom has a rare moment of softness and returns Tabby to Mildred.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stories about the everyday lives of ordinary children living in eight different countries around the world. In this programme we visit three children who are all having a very busy day. In Jordan, seven-year-old Hamza is having trouble getting up for school. But will he get there in time? At school in Vietnam, Truc, who's seven, plays lots of games, has a tasty lunch and a little sleep with her friends. And after school in India, six-year-old Anushka learns how to draw patterns on the ground called Rangoli with her aunt. In each film we see that although children live in different countries, may look different and speak different languages, the joys and challenges of childhood are universal.(n)</desc>
