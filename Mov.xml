    <title lang="en">Gangsta Granny</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Schoolboy Ben is bored witless after being made to stay with his grandma. All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and none other than Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben</desc>

Mother Clanger is worried when she sees it snowing rather than raining, and she calls for Major Clanger to come and have a look. The Clangers have never seen snow before. Major Clanger finds it very interesting and decides to take a sample to his workshop to analyse, but he's amazed to see that it has disappeared and has been replaced by water. While Small Clanger and Baby Soup Dragon enjoy a snowball fight, Tiny Clanger spots The Cloud shivering and comes up with a clever plan. Will Tiny's plan be enough to stop The Cloud shivering?</desc>
