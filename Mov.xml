    <desc lang="pl">Londyńczycy kochają tradycję. Również Rachel ceni sobie tradycyjną kuchnię. Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia. Na zakończenie przypomni miłośnikom gotowania przepis na tradycyjny brytyjski pudding(c)</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Londyńczycy kochają tradycję. Również Rachel ceni sobie tradycyjną kuchnię. Szczególnie bliskie jej sercu i... żołądkowi są dania, które mimo upływu czasu wciąż cieszą się powodzeniem wśród smakoszy. Dziś Rachel spotyka się z właścicielem popularnego bistro, który zdradzi jej rodzinny przepis. Receptura przez wiele lat zapewniała sukces prowadzonemu od pokoleń biznesowi. Wybierze się ze znajomymi do pubu i przy okazji sprawdzi, dlaczego jaja po szkocku cieszą się dużym powodzeniem wśród klientów barów z przekąskami. Po powrocie do domu Rachel przyrządzi pieczeń, która jest tak łatwa w przygotowaniu, że można serwować ją nawet w środku tygodnia. Na zakończenie przypomni miłośnikom gotowania przepis na tradycyjny brytyjski pudding(c)</desc>

Z kolei Bożena i Olga idą na siłownię, by zgubić kilka kilogramów przed zabiegiem. Na miejscu spotykają Karolinę, która również musi schudnąć. Emil i Ela po operacji jedzą swój pierwszy posiłek - kleik. Tymczasem na siłowni Karolina zaczyna mieć problem z kręgosłupem i musi opuścić salę treningową. Bożena i Olga wyciskają siódme poty. Emil po powrocie ze szpitala postanawia nauczyć swojego pupila Dolara posłuszeństwa i zapisuje go na tresurę, co też zwiększa aktywność chłopaka. Ela po incydentach z ciśnieniem zaczyna regularnie je kontrolować. Bożena i Olga przechodzą próbę wagi</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gangsta Granny</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Schoolboy Ben is bored witless after being made to stay with his grandma. All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and none other than Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben.</desc>

When Jas and her dad suggest `shaking it up' a bit this year and introducing a Mexican theme, it leads first of all to the parents falling out and then to Martha and Jas themselves. It's the battle of the lobster vs the Mexican donkey pinata called Percy.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Salford Curse.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Jas decides to follow in her dad's footsteps and try out for the junior hockey team. Mr Salford was a legendary hockey goalie in his time at the school. When the try-outs are cancelled due to the coach not being available, Mr Salford steps in and offers his services as coach. Mrs Griggs is horrified - she could do without the chaos he inevitably brings with him - but he won't take no for an answer. Jas and her father are really superstitious and when things start going wrong Jas thinks she's jinxed, and then that she's passed on the jinx to her dad. When she's not picked as goalie for the team Jas is actually relieved - it must mean she's still jinxed and hasn't passed on the jinx to her dad. Eventually Jas does need to play in goal, but when she saves a crucial penalty she and her dad are delighted to realise they are not jinxed after all, just accident-prone! Meanwhile, Martha &amp; Ollie get paranoid that Cassie &amp; Maxwell are usurping them. They've taken over their favourite nook in the library and when they turn up to do their regular security check on Mrs Rennison's computer Cassie and Maxwell have already been there and done it. They decide they've got to get their own back and they sabotage a fizzy drinks maker Cassie and Maxwell have created to provide refreshments at the hockey match. They turn up the CO2 dial and everyone gets very burpy! Lily is feeling abandoned by her friends - they all seem too busy to hang out with her. Matt advises her that a big gesture could do the trick. When she unfurls a giant banner during the hockey match declaring her admiration for her friends it's really embarrassing. It does prompt Martha and Ollie to do the right thing, though, and confess to Cassie and Maxwell that they sabotaged their fizzy drinks machine and does inspire Jas to save that crucial penalty.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Eye Contact 101.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Mrs Griggs decides that a 'social skills' class could be beneficial for certain pupils - including Martha, Rufus, Cassie and Maxwell. When Mrs Griggs tells Martha a winning personality as well as academic achievement is vital in order to get into a top university, Martha panics and is determined to succeed in the social skills class and prove she does indeed have a winning personality. Mrs Griggs volunteers a reluctant Mr Malone to take the classes and hands him a book written by her beloved 'Guru Holeman' called Being Whole as a manual to help him. When Lily is mistakenly led to believe by Jas that Matt is emigrating to Australia she is distraught that he hasn't even told her he's leaving. She becomes convinced it's because she's too easy-going that he hasn't even bothered to tell her. She begs Mrs Griggs to let her go to social skills class, too, so she can learn to be less easy-going. Ollie is then sent there for being too pompous and Jas for being too exuberant. Worn down, eventually Mr Malone has had enough of teaching the class Mrs Griggs' way. He throws the book in the bin and gives the pupils a new exercise of his own - wearing blindfolds so they can feel free without worrying how people see them. It works - a blindfolded Lily is able to tell Matt she'll really miss him when he emigrates, which prompts Matt to tell her that he's not going anywhere. And Martha realises she's doing just fine with the personality she already has.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gangsta Granny</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Schoolboy Ben is bored witless after being made to stay with his grandma. All she ever wants to do is play Scrabble and eat yucky cabbage soup. But it turns out there's a whole lot more to this OAP than cardigans and toffees when she tells him how she used to be an international jewel thief - and when she admits there was one heist she never quite managed in her heyday, the pair set out on a criminal adventure. Julie McKenzie stars as the shady senior citizen, with Walliams and Miranda Hart as the boys' ballroom-dancing parents, alongside Joanna Lumley, Rob Brydon and none other than Robbie Williams, with Reece Buttery as Ben.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mr Stink</title>
    <desc lang="en">Family comedy based on the children's novel by David Walliams. Twelve-year-old Chloe leads a lonely existence - her mother is too busy with her political ambitions to take any interest in her daughter, her hen-pecked dad is hiding a secret of his own and she cannot hope to compete with her `perfect' younger sister - to say nothing of the nasty girls who make her school life a misery. So when she meets a tramp in need of somewhere to stay, she invites him to hide in her family's garden shed - but it soon turns out there is more to her smelly guest than meets the eye. Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville stars, with Sheridan Smith, Johnny Vegas and Isabella Blake-Thomas, and an appearance from Britain's Got Talent winner Pudsey the dog.(n)</desc>
