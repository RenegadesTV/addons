Botanist Dr Martin Harris is attending a science conference in Berlin when he realises he's left his papers at the airport and jumps in a cab and sets off to retrieve them. But en route he's involved in a massive pile-up that leaves him unconscious and hospitalised. Coming round, he discovers that no one knows who he is, and he has no proof of his identity. Worse, back at the hotel, his wife Elizabeth not only claims not to recognise him but also says another man is her husband. Bewildered, Harris sets out to unpick what the hell is going on, with the help of taxi driver Gina, who rescued him from the accident. And the further he investigates, the clearer it becomes that something is seriously amiss - and that dark forces are out to put a permanent end to his search for the truth...

The Simpsons attend the annual rodeo at Waterville State Penitentiary after a disappointing visit to an Apron Expo, and Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a painful run-in with a bull. While at the prison, Marge meets a handsome convict Jack (voice of Michael Keaton), and while she's told he has such a reputation Bob Dylan wrote a protest song to keep him behind bars, Marge is certain he has a sensitive side that ought to be nurtured. Marge persuades the Warden (voice of Charles Napier) to let her teach an art class at the prison, and Jack soon becomes her star pupil. Swayed by Jack's charm, good looks and talent, Marge speaks out in favor of his parole, and once he's freed, helps him land a job at Springfield Elementary School, where Principal Skinner (voice of Harry Shearer) hires him to create a mural celebrating the school's motto, "Puma Pride." Jack's finished product, however, isn't what Marge or Skinner has in mind, and soon Jack lapses back into his criminal lifestyle. "Pokey Mom" first aired on January 14, 2001</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sweet Liberty</title>
    <desc lang="en">Alan Alda wrote, directed, and starred in this satirical film about the corruption of the film industry's approach to history. Alda plays Michael Burgess, a college professor who has written a historical novel about the American Revolution. The book has been turned into a script, and a Hollywood film crew descends on his North Carolina hometown to make the movie. Predictably, the director and actors make a mess of his concept, and Burgess becomes frustrated as the town is turned upside down. Desperately, he tries to salvage his concept with some last-minute script changes. To make things more complicated, Burgess falls in love with the glamorous female lead in the film, Faith Healy (Michelle Pfeiffer). Meanwhile, his long-time girlfriend, Gretchen (Lise Hilboldt) is pressuring him to get married. The film's male star, Elliott James (Michael Caine), finally shows up in town and becomes Burgess's rival for Faith's affections. Silent film star Lillian Gish appears as Burgess's smother(n)</desc>

Now forced to make the sale of a lifetime or face a grim fate working behind the counter of the local butcher, the two hapless meat-slingers set their sights on a foolproof prospect that promises to provide just the funds needed to keep them afloat. Unfortunately for Maurice and Dave, their perfect plan leads them into the company of some very bad men, and now with their jobs on the line and their lives hanging in the balance, these two scheming salesmen must finalize the big deal and get the money back to the boss before they end up in the freezer with the rest of the dead meat(n)</desc>

Though understandably wary, Bill heads to Buzzsaw, where he promptly loses his paperwork on the deal in progress and is confronted by the city's remarkable collection of eccentrics, including the crazed fugitive Sally (Heidi Kling), the subnormal Jim Jr. and Jim Sr. (John C. Reilly and Michael Monks), and Ann (Marian Mercer), the mayor's loopy wife. It turns out that Marci wasn't entirely wrong; year's ago, Peter's diabolical twin brother Matt (also played by Jones) was sent to jail in his brother's place on criminal charges, and now Matt has violent revenge on his mind.

Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires.

Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rugrats in Paris: The Movie</title>
    <desc lang="en">The biggest babies in the entertainment business take their act to Europe in this sequel to the surprise-hit animated feature The Rugrats Movie. Chuckie (voice of Christine Cavanaugh) has been fretting over his father Chas (voice of Michael Bell) and his status as a single father, as he wants to have a mommy like all of his friends. Chas and his father Stu (voice of Jack Riley) were hired to create a bevy of electronic critters for the newly opened Euro-Reptarland theme park, but the robots are acting up, and park manager Coco La Bouche (Susan Sarandon) is hopping mad. So Stu and Chas are flown to Paris to do some repairs, with Chas bringing Chuckie and all his friends along. Their visit to the City of Lights proves to be one adventure after another, as Chuckie tries to find a suitable mother (with Coco leading the pack) and Tommy (voice of Elizabeth Dailey) somehow gets behind the wheel of the giant Reptar robot. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie features original songs from T-Boz from TLC, The Baha Men, and Mylene Farmer, while John Lithgow, Debbie Reynolds, and Mako contribute to the voice cast(n)</desc>

And lawyer Willy Beachum can be forgiven for thinking that his last case as a criminal attorney (before he switches to company law) will be a doddle. But once in court, Crawford, representing himself, starts to tear apart the ample evidence that's stacked against him... Can he possibly get away with his crime?

    <desc lang="en">Trickster Sacha Baron Cohen offers yet another stinging dose of satire in this comedy that finds him assuming the persona of gay fashionmonger Bruno, the self-proclaimed "voice of Austrian youth TV." Originally conceived as part of the cult TV series "Da Ali G Show," the character of Bruno offers Cohen the opportunity to highlight the absurdities of homophobia and the fashion industry by interviewing celebrities, politicians and haute-couture hangers-on.

With a party to organise the gang get to work - Matilda's brother Jack and sisters Megan and Holly take shopping to another level as they speed along the river Thames on a high-performance rib to pick up supplies. Matilda's in charge of the party food: build your own spicy sausage pitta bread sandwiches with zingy yoghurt sauce and popcorn cakes. The popcorn cakes idea came from Scarlet, a Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch viewer who emailed it to Matilda's Food Blog. Great food, friends and fun, and the party finishing with a bang when the guys play an explosive game with a watermelon - parties don't get much better!.</desc>
