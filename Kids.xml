		<title>Deadly 60Our Planet Matters</title>
		<desc>The oil palm is a remarkable tree, with an incredibly diverse fruit that can be used for many different things - from shampoo and soap to toothpaste, crisps and chocolate. Unfortunately, the spread of this remarkable plant is leading to the destruction of the rainforests, particularly in Borneo and Sumatra. So what can we do? Firstly, learn where your food is coming from. Pay attention to the labels and look out for sustainable palm oil. We can’t get rid of palm oil altogether as it is in countless products, and many of the alternatives would be worse. But there are different ways of making palm oil, some of which will not completely destroy the forests. The next thing you could do is buy some forest for yourself. It is possible to fundraise, to get money to purchase a piece of perfect rainforest and protect it. So why not see if you can wash cars, and buy a piece of forest the size of your classroom, the size of your assembly hall, possibly even the size of your school. Finally, think about how you use wood and paper. Make sure you recycle and be sure to think about your impact on the world in every single thing you do. If we don’t, then rainforests could be condemned to history.</desc>

		<title>GiggleQuiz</title>
		<sub-title>Ann Teak's Antiques Wand</sub-title>
		<desc>Joining Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz are the Lost Pirate and Ann Teak.\n\nKeith finds an old stick under his desk, and Ann Teak gives her 'expert' opinion on what it is. Ann declares that the artefact must be a conductor's baton and demonstrates how to use it. Unbeknownst to Ann, the stick is actually a magic wand and waving it around causes Arthur's phone to turn into a pineapple.  \n\nThroughout the third round, Ann Teak obliviously performs her own magic spells in the studio. She changes the Lost Pirate's telescope into a banana, Gail's new autobiography into a cabbage and Keith into a dog!  As the quiz comes to a close, Ann finally realises what her 'baton' actually is and throws it away before it can cause any more problems.</desc>

Next, Maddie visits a factory where cricket bats are made from willow trees, because it’s bouncy and strong.  First the tree trunk is cut using a chainsaw and we learn how the wood is shaped using lots of different cutting and sanding machines. We see inside a robot that is shaped like a pineapple!

She visits a revolving door workshop to see how panels of glass are fixed to something called a carousel so that the panels move when we push them. Then she uses a special camera to show how a sensor at the top of an automatic revolving door spots us so it can start to turn.\n\nNext, Maddie heads to a neon sign workshop and uses her thermal imaging camera to see how glass is heated until it’s really, really hot. It can then be bent into lots of different shapes. We see how the glass tubes are filled with argon gas – when electricity passes through them, they light up!(n)</desc>

		<title>Fireman Sam</title>
		<desc>"Fireman Sam" is an animated children's series about a friendly fireman, his fellow firefighters and other townspeople in the Welsh town of Pontypandy. Sam remains composed in any emergency and always offers assistance to anyone in need. When he is not putting out fires, he spends his spare time in his shed, where he makes devices such as a potato-picker assembled from bicycle parts and a machine capable of replacing the town's band. His catchphrase is "Great fires of London!" His colleagues are Fireman Elvis Cridlington, who aspires to be a rock star, Station Officer Basil Steele, the chief of Pontypandy Fire Station, Firefighter Penny Morris, the only female member of the brigade, and Auxiliary Fireman Trevor Evans, a West Indian fireman who is also the town's bus driver. Other characters include Dilys Price, who runs the local grocery store, Bella Lasagne, an absent-minded café owner, Sarah and James Jones, who are Sam's niece and nephew, and Norman Price, a boy who loves practical jokes and skateboarding. The original series of 32 episodes between 1987 and 1994 featured stop-motion animation. The latest series update in 2008 features computer-generated animation. It can be seen on Channel Five.</desc>
