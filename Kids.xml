		<title>Deadly Predators</title>
		<sub-title>Shark</sub-title>
		<desc>In this episode, Steve uncovers the secrets of sharks, the world's most infamous predators. He heads out into the Atlantic ocean to dive with blue sharks, a beautiful but deadly species which can travel up to 10,000km per year looking for food. He finds out how their big pectoral fins allow them to glide gracefully through the water, and how they are now threatened by overfishing for their fins. Next up, we head into the Deadly Den on a mission to find the ultimate shark's jaw. Steve has had two shark jaws made into amazing mechanical models. First is the cookie cutter, a shark that takes perfectly circular chunks of flesh out of their prey. Steve demonstrates the cookie cutter's bite using his mechanical jaw on some fruit. Next up is the bluntnose sixgill, which uses its jaws like a hacksaw. We then head outside to see the biggest shark jaws ever to have existed - the megalodon. Using the latest CGI, we see what this true monster of the deep looked like in real life. Then it's time go in search of a very special shark - the salmon shark. These predators can hunt in waters of minus two degrees, keeping themselves warm using some amazing adaptations. To investigate, Steve heads to the Extreme Environment Lab at Portsmouth Uni, where he becomes two fish - prey Steve and salmon shark Steve. They race each other in a swimming treadmill filled with cold water, but who will win, predator or prey? Finally, Steve dives into a flooded quarry to become a great hammerhead shark. These amazing animals use super-sensing electro reception to detect prey hidden on the bottom of the ocean. Steve tries his hand at this by using an underwater metal detector to find deadly treasure hidden at the bottom of the quarry.</desc>

		<title>Deadly Predators</title>
		<sub-title>Speed</sub-title>
		<desc>In this episode, Steve goes in search of the fastest Deadly Predators on earth. Using the latest CGI, Steve high-dives off a rugged cliff in Wales next to a gannet, tests the speed and accuracy of a gannet dive in a sky-high experiment in his deadly junkyard using a crane and an old caravan, and takes to the kayak for an amazing animal encounter with thousands of wild gannets. Then it's on to the rare blue fin tuna, the UK's fastest fish and one that is making a comeback in the UK after being close to extinction. Steve heads out to the open ocean in search of these deadly predators, and along the way he meets some other fast-swimming contenders, including whales and dolphins. He also finds a bait ball of small fish that has attracted predators from all around, and volunteers to be dragged behind the boat to test the tuna's famous speed. One of the planets ultimate speedy predators is the cheetah. Steve puts the cheetah's acceleration to the test against an electric sports car, and we explore how a cheetah is supremely designed for speed and how they make phenomenal predators. We then meet the fastest animal ever to live - the peregrine falcon. They are the ultimate speedy predator, and their turbo-charged stoop leaves their prey with little chance of escape. Steve wants to put these aerial assassins to the test, and heads to the rugged Snowdonian mountains for a high-adrenaline mountain biking speed challenge where trained peregrine Rudi hunts him down.</desc>

The film introduces Kareem and his family, before heading to the Ayowole Academy of Art, a makeshift art studio in a poor neighborhood in Lagos. From the picture he wants to draw of his grandma in a village many miles away, to the picture he wants to draw of Olu's brother Samuel - a child amputee - through to the fishermen of the Makoko floating village and the elephants of Oyo National Park. These poignant pictures and their settings, hope to showcase the vibrancy, colour and beauty in Africa and evoke the wonder of Wakanda in Black Panther. After the pictures are created, it's on to the exhibition space, where many of Kareems peers and heroes await, in what promises to be an emotional and life-changing experience for Kareem and his family as he finally takes the first steps towards becoming a young master.</desc>

		<title>Deadly Predators</title>
		<sub-title>Predator Power</sub-title>
		<desc>In this episode, Steve goes in search of some of the most powerful predators on the planet. At historic Warwick Castle, we meet the stellar sea eagle, world's heaviest eagle. Our eagle Nikita is an expert at lifting fish up to one third of her body weight out of the ocean to eat. To demonstrate this amazing ability up close, Steve has one of the coolest pieces of tech in Deadly history - a time slice rig. Using this, Steve is able to analyse Nikita's predatory power from every angle. Next, Steve goes head to head with one of the strongest land predators - the bear. Bears aren't just strong, they are incredibly agile too. During the summer they have to catch and eat up to 30 whole salmon before hibernation. Steve puts this to the test by wearing a bear suit and being drenched in water - can he catch as many salmon as a hungry bear? On a mission to find the world's most powerful punch, Steve tries his hand at boxing with a fairground punching machine. He is no match for our professional boxer Isaac though, who gives Steve a few punching tips. However, when it comes to powerful punches, nothing can beat the peacock mantis shrimp. Despite being only six inches long, its punch has the same power as a bullet. We see in incredible CGI what a human-sized mantis shrimp could do to our boxing machine. Steve then reveals its secret superpower - it doesn't just hit with its punch, it also creates a shockwave of energy in the water. Steve supersizes this and blows up a fish tank full of water with some plastic explosives. Finally, Steve comes face to face with his favourite animal in the world - the wolf. At a special zoo in the UK, Steve meets a real wolf and a hybrid wolf, and puts their pack and jaw power to the test - can he win a tug of war with our wolf using a real deer's leg. We then head to the quarry, where Steve shows us how a wolf uses its powerful jaws to hang on to prey by trying his hand at a bucking bronco.</desc>

		<title>The Toddler Club at Home</title>
		<desc>Nigel, Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear welcome toddlers Freddie, Dylan, William and Afal, and their grown-ups to the Toddler Club. Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! The What's in the Box? game reveals a wooden toy aeroplane, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all inspired by an 'in the air' theme. This subject is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate 'in the air' object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear are given a kite as a present. The twins go outside to fly it, but things don't quite go to plan when the kite gets stuck in a tree! Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the 'in the air' theme too. Plus, the Big Band Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

		<sub-title>Rapids Johnson's Helping Bear</sub-title>
		<desc>Joining Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz are Captain Adorable and Rapids Johnson.\n\nAlways on the lookout for bears, Rapids Johnson gives Keith some tips on how best to find the elusive Helping Bear. Unbeknownst to Rapids, the Helping Bear has already been giving the teams some clues to the answers. The ever-helpful bear delivers all the things that Rapids says he needs to spot the Helping Bear, including bear spotter's notepaper, paper cups (because bear spotting is thirsty work) and camouflage. Keith desperately tries to get Rapids' attention every time the bear appears, but Rapids remains oblivious.\n\nIn the third round, the Helping Bear once again assists the teams by pointing out the correct safety gear, tipping leaves on Rapids' head and even accepting a phone call from Gail asking for the answer! When awarding a gigglepoint, Arthur accidentally sets off a leaf blower that sends all of Rapids' bear spotting equipment flying off the desk.  The Helping Bear makes yet another appearance, coming to the rescue by turning off the leaf blower. Everybody except Rapids spots the bear!</desc>

		<sub-title>Professor Muddles' Handy Invention</sub-title>
		<desc>Joining Gail and Keith for today's quiz are Rapids Johnson and Professor Muddles.\n\nIn the first round, the contestants fly paper aeroplanes around the studio. To tidy up the planes, Professor Muddles presents his latest invention: the Stretcherama 5000. The device stretches Professor Muddles' arms out so he can help pick up the aeroplanes without leaving his seat. But the Professor hasn't quite mastered controlling his long arms, so Arthur has to duck as they stretch over his desk.\n\nThe third round features a clip of Ann Teak inspecting some bowling balls. But it is Rapids Johnson who ends up getting bowled over when Doreen throws him a giant ball. Holding the giant beach ball, Rapids is unable to press his buzzer, so Professor Muddle has to give him a hand.</desc>

		<desc>Rosa and Pola are planning a family movie afternoon, but Tish and Bobby can’t decide on what to watch. They end up picking Bobby's favourite, but Tish is frustrated that he always gets his way. She imagines Bobby World, a world full of his favourite toys. Eventually Tash realises all the toys in that world were once Tish's, so they are actually in Tish World. Tish then decides to give Bobby's favourite show a go, since that's the one thing he chose for himself.</desc>

		<desc>Nigel, Bailee Bear and Benjee Bair welcome toddlers Afal, William, Eleanor, Romy and Freddie, and their grown-ups, to the Toddler Club. Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! The What's in the Box? game reveals a ball, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all about sports. This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate sports object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear have a pretend sports day. The twins find lots of ways to help them jump, run, climb and balance. Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the sports theme too. Plus, the Toddler Club Bop gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

		<title>Fireman Sam</title>
		<desc>"Fireman Sam" is an animated children's series about a friendly fireman, his fellow firefighters and other townspeople in the Welsh town of Pontypandy. Sam remains composed in any emergency and always offers assistance to anyone in need. When he is not putting out fires, he spends his spare time in his shed, where he makes devices such as a potato-picker assembled from bicycle parts and a machine capable of replacing the town's band. His catchphrase is "Great fires of London!" His colleagues are Fireman Elvis Cridlington, who aspires to be a rock star, Station Officer Basil Steele, the chief of Pontypandy Fire Station, Firefighter Penny Morris, the only female member of the brigade, and Auxiliary Fireman Trevor Evans, a West Indian fireman who is also the town's bus driver. Other characters include Dilys Price, who runs the local grocery store, Bella Lasagne, an absent-minded café owner, Sarah and James Jones, who are Sam's niece and nephew, and Norman Price, a boy who loves practical jokes and skateboarding. The original series of 32 episodes between 1987 and 1994 featured stop-motion animation. The latest series update in 2008 features computer-generated animation. It can be seen on Channel Five.</desc>
