    <desc lang="en">Hanner canrif yn ol anfonwyd dau ffrind o Fethesda i ymladd yn Rhyfel Corea fel rhan o'u Gwasanaeth Cenedlaethol gyda'r Fyddin Brydeinig. Yn ddiweddar aeth y ddau yn ol i Gorea i ail-droedio'r hen lwybrau. Atgofion tra gwahanol o'r rhyfel sydd gan y ddau. Roedd John Davies yn filwr gyda'r Royal Artillery, a yrrwyd i ganol erchyllterau'r llinell flaen. Clerc yn yr Ordnance Corps yn prisio offer yn Siapan oedd Owen Williams trwy gydol y rhyfel. Ar ol blynyddoedd o rannu atgofion gyda'i ffrind, mae John yn mynd ag Owen yn ol i'r llinell flaen. Korean war veterans John Davies and Owen Williams take a tour of their old haunts, after years of reminiscing together made them realise how different their experiences were. As one became a soldier on the frontline, the other worked as a clerk in Japan, enabling them to share different sides of the same stories.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">BB King - The Life of Riley</title>
    <desc lang="en">The American blues singer-songwriter recounts his story of a rise to prominence in the music industry, earning him the title `King of the Blues'. Born into a world of oppression in the cotton plantations outside Berclair, Mississippi, he went on to assemble his own band under the guidance of Millard Lee and found widespread popularity with his Singin' the Blues album in the Elvis-charged swinging zeitgeist of 1956. His talent showed no bounds, and more than half a century later he released his 42nd studio album, One Kind Favor, by which time he was well into his eighties - and showing no sign of giving up. Filmed in locations across the States, as well as the United Kingdom, and featuring contributions by a range of fellow musicians including Eric Clapton, Bono, George Benson and Mick Hucknall. Narrated by Morgan Freeman.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">What Are You Eating</title>
    <desc lang="en">Up until the 1950s, food was a relatively simple matter, with narrow choice and a constant battle to keep food fresh. Fast forward to the present day and mass production, intensive farming, refrigeration, freezing and food technology have provided more choice and lower prices. However, a sizeable proportion of food is now processed to maintain freshness, leading presenter Philip Boucher-Hayes to ask if people really know what they are eating. In the first edition, the presenter examines how the Irish consumer has changed over the years, and is joined by chef Hilary O'Hagan to look at processed meat products and the Paleo diet.(n)</desc>

However, the stakes have never been higher, and a disaster in any one of the rounds might mean the difference between claiming a place in the final, or bowing out early. In the Signature, the bakers must achieve perfect lamination on French pastries, and in the Technical, Paul Hollywood puts the amateurs through their paces with a yeast-based cake with a fruity top and delicate chocolate work. For the Showstopper finale, the competitors face a multiple mini-cake bake, with Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry expecting a high-end finish that demonstrates the bakers' ability to manage their time.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Patisserie Week</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Only four bakers remain as the semi-final arrives. This week, the contestants must demonstrate their mastery of patisserie in three more challenges. However, the stakes have never been higher, and a disaster in any one of the rounds might mean the difference between claiming a place in the final, or bowing out early. In the Signature, the bakers must achieve perfect lamination on French pastries, and in the Technical, Paul Hollywood puts the amateurs through their paces with a yeast-based cake with a fruity top and delicate chocolate work. For the Showstopper finale, the competitors face a multiple mini-cake bake, with Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry expecting a high-end finish that demonstrates the bakers' ability to manage their time.(n)</desc>

The ingredients include chicken giblets and skin, bones, pigs' ears, fish heads and bones, potato peelings and stale bread, so they need to use their ingenuity as well as their skill - and for one, it'll be the last dish they ever make on MasterChef. The rest are left to prepare a six-course menu for an esteemed group of experts who make their living analysing food and drink - so they won't be easy to please.(n)</desc>
