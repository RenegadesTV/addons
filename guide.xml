Nigella's simple rice bowl with ginger, radish and avocado celebrates a few choice ingredients and results in a dish that's uplifting to look at, as well as to eat(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">England v Lithuania (Kick-off 5.00pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the Group F clash between the countries at Wembley Stadium. Gareth Southgate's side currently top the qualifying table, but the manager will know his men need to maintain their good form if they are to remain in top spot, with Slovenia - who play Scotland later today - breathing down their necks in second place. The Lithuanians comes into this contest having suffered a 4-0 loss away to Slovakia in their most recent qualifier, but have also claimed a 1-1 draw away to Scotland earlier in the campaign, and could make things difficult for England if they attempt to stymie their attacking play. With commentary by Clive Tyldesley and Glenn Hoddle, and analysis by Ryan Giggs, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Voice UK (?)</title>
    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First Steps</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts. Here the elders lead a troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed to dig wells(n)</desc>

An orphaned young chimp tries to climb the social ladder, but his troop is ruled by big, aggressive males and his first attempt to join them ends in a beating. A meerkat society will only allow newcomers in if they know how to deal with a venomous snake. And the only way to occupy the top spot in a meadow of kangaroos is to beat the ruling male in a boxing match - but few have challenged the current incumbent, who stands at 8ft. Will any animal dare take him on? David Attenborough narrates(n)</desc>

A male flame bowerbird shows off its artistic prowess to impress a potential mate - but if that does not prove enough, it will demonstrate its dancing skills instead. Waved albatrosses pair up for life and spend hours in each other's company, although things are not so simple for a male peacock jumping spider - one wrong move in its dazzling courtship routine could prove fatal. However, one of the most magnificent displays of all is created by a tiny male pufferfish, which impresses the ladies by building a spectacular underwater `crop circle' in the sand - arguably the most perfect and complex structure created by any animal(n)</desc>

A turtle hauls itself up the beach to lay its eggs in a safe place, only for the tide to trap it behind a wall of coral.

    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Home</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts.

    <sub-title lang="en">Power</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of power in the animal kingdom, revealing how dominant creatures have the best access to food and water, and are also the most attractive to the opposite sex. An orphaned young chimp tries to climb the social ladder, but his troop is ruled by big, aggressive males and his first attempt to join them ends in a beating. A meerkat society will only allow newcomers in if they know how to deal with a venomous snake. And the only way to occupy the top spot in a meadow of kangaroos is to beat the ruling male in a boxing match - but few have challenged the current incumbent, who stands at 8ft. Will any animal dare take him on? David Attenborough narrates(n)</desc>

A male flame bowerbird shows off its artistic prowess to impress a potential mate - but if that does not prove enough, it will demonstrate its dancing skills instead. Waved albatrosses pair up for life and spend hours in each other's company, although things are not so simple for a male peacock jumping spider - one wrong move in its dazzling courtship routine could prove fatal. However, one of the most magnificent displays of all is created by a tiny male pufferfish, which impresses the ladies by building a spectacular underwater `crop circle' in the sand - arguably the most perfect and complex structure created by any animal(n)</desc>

A turtle hauls itself up the beach to lay its eggs in a safe place, only for the tide to trap it behind a wall of coral.

Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

The Lithuanians comes into this contest having suffered a 4-0 loss away to Slovakia in their most recent qualifier, but have also claimed a 1-1 draw away to Scotland earlier in the campaign, and could make things difficult for England if they attempt to stymie their attacking play.

    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Pies</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Heston Blumenthal delves into the history of iconic British dishes to find inspiration for a culinary salute, beginning with a three-course pie banquet. For his starter, he learns about the `surprise' pies of the 17th century and a dwarf boy who would jump out of one at a grand feast. Heston prepares a gala pie made up of beetroot and horseradish ice-cream in place of meat, with goat's cheese panna cotta, saffron and bacon, and the main course is a gothic affair inspired by Sweeney Todd. The chef also sets out to make the lightest ever mash with an attempt to change the molecular structure of a potato. The dinner is served to a select group of pie-makers 100ft in the air over the East End of London(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The end of year exams are looming and Maud's annoyed that distracted Mildred isn't taking revision seriously. Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her(n)</desc>
