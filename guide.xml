    <title lang="en">Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief</title>
    <desc lang="en">After three weeks of enthusiastic mimicry, the comedy-themed musical talent show draws to a close. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins are on hand to present a live grand final, in which the six most popular celebrity performers from the previous three rounds battle it out. Back on March 4, first-round judges Katharine Ryan, Jo Brand and Frank Skinner were suitably impressed by Sara Pascoe's acrobatic turn as Chandelier singer Sia, while the public were wowed by Rickie Haywood and Melvin Odoom's 1990s-era Will Smith medley. These two acts became the first to grab a confirmed place in the final, and tonight, they perform alongside their rivals from successive weeks to determine which off-beat performance will ultimately be named the winner. Taking a seat on the panel this week are Rufus Hound, Katy Brand and Jason Manford, while Zara Larsson and Dua Lipa perform. Last in the series(n)</desc>

Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins are on hand to present a live grand final, in which the six most popular celebrity performers from the previous three rounds battle it out. Back on March 4, first-round judges Katharine Ryan, Jo Brand and Frank Skinner were suitably impressed by Sara Pascoe's acrobatic turn as Chandelier singer Sia, while the public were wowed by Rickie Haywood and Melvin Odoom's 1990s-era Will Smith medley. These two acts became the first to grab a confirmed place in the final, and tonight, they perform alongside their rivals from successive weeks to determine which off-beat performance will ultimately be named the winner. Taking a seat on the panel this week are Rufus Hound, Katy Brand and Jason Manford, while Zara Larsson and Dua Lipa perform. Last in the series(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An international team of experts assembles to investigate the discovery of a 4,000-year-old body found preserved in an Irish peat bog in Cashel, Co Tipperary. Led by Ned Kelly of the National Museum of Ireland, the archaeologists look at whether the find will help prove Ned's theory that these mummified corpses were once ancient kings, and what clues the cadavers found in the boglands of northern Europe can offer to explain the history of ritual murder. However, new scientific research suggests these deaths may be explained by prehistoric climate change(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold(n)</desc>

Miss Cackle goes to the cottage in the woods to learn Agatha has escaped. Ethel is desperate to find out the secret, so she does an impersonation spell to transform into Maud, hoping Mildred will open up to her. Mildred and Enid work out Ethel's plan and tell 'Maud' that the big secret is that Mildred is Miss Cackle's niece. Miss Cackle is annoyed and grounds the two of them. Mildred thinks Miss Cackle isn't herself and worries Agatha had returned from the cottage so she flies to Agatha's cottage in the woods. She meets Agatha and Gullet at the cottage and they try to take her powers, but she escapes. Ethel finds the birth scroll just as Miss Gullet and Agatha arrive at the castle. Esmerelda unwittingly invites them in, thinking Agatha is Miss Cackle, and gives up her powers - only to learn she's given them to the wrong sister. Agatha announces to the school that she is in charge. When Mildred finally arrives back at the castle, she's greeted by Maud and Miss Hardbroom who expels her(n)</desc>
