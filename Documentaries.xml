The incident was witnessed by multiple aviation professionals, pilots and passengers. The immediate aftermath of the event was captured in real time by audio recordings of communication between the airport's Air Traffic Control tower and airline staff, but the sighting was dismissed by the US government's Federal Aviation Administration as a weather phenomenon. Craig and Sarah talk to UFO investigator Robert Powell, who reveals the UFO punched a circular hole in the clouds as it departed upwards after hovering over the terminal.

		<title>Natural World</title>
		<desc>Bill Bailey narrates this natural history documentary telling the story of some of nature's most extraordinary partnerships, revealing what sometimes happens when animals need an itch scratching, help getting into food or home security assistance. The answer is, to find a partner - and not necessarily one of the same species. Highlights include hippos joining forces with fish for a full-body exfoliation and ravens inviting wolverines over for some bone-crunching assistance with their dinner.</desc>

Along the way he soaks up the sights and sounds of Havana, retraces the footsteps of the country's national hero Che Guevara, and visits the ghost town of Camilo Cienfuegos - a relic from Cuba's colonial sugar plantation era.</desc>
