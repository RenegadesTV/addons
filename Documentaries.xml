		<sub-title>Slaver Ship Secrets</sub-title>
		<desc>The actor is joined by advanced technical diver Emily Turton in north Devon, as he prepares to dive down on the wreck of a sunken steam ship. Iona II was heading to America in the early 1860s, when it went down with a mystery cargo on board that the owners went to extensive efforts to recover in secret. The pair embark on a night dive with the hope it will reveal what the owners so desperately tried to covertly retrieve. Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, Ross also meets with a maritime historian who has uncovered Iona II's shocking purpose. Ross and maritime archaeologist Mallory Haas head to Plymouth to dive on a newly discovered wreck, and to uncover a staggering artefact that links the site to one of the most controversial and censored periods in British history - the transatlantic slave trade.</desc>

The naturalist explores the evolution of vertebrates over the past 500 million years, beginning with a look at how remarkable advances allowed primitive fish to make the radical move on to land, and then take to the skies with the advent of flight. He uses fossils of both ancient and living species combined with CGI and film to chart their journey out of the water to populate all corners of the globe.</desc>

Beginning the journey near his childhood home in Charnwood Forest, Leicestershire, he learns how a fossil discovery transformed scientists' understanding of the evolution of complex organisms, and in Newfoundland and Australia he reveals the earliest kinds of animal to exist on the planet. With the help of cutting-edge technology and visual effects, the programme brings the creatures to life, demonstrating how they survived.</desc>

Thanks to a rare alignment of the planets in 1976, Voyager 2 was sent for mankind's only flyby of these ice worlds. Even at such cold temperatures, great storms whip around these frozen worlds, which are home to spectacular moons and intricate ring systems.

In this film, he takes viewers into the weird and wonderful world of the amphibian, shedding new light on the charismatic, colourful and frequently bizarre creatures, and examining their anatomy, extraordinary behaviour and ability to survive in some of the most extreme places on the planet.</desc>

Today, Jupiter's great mass continues to be felt. Its gravity torments its moon Io, creating the most volcanically active body in the solar system. And through the vice-like grip it exerts over the asteroid belt, Jupiter's influence extends as far as Earth.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Brian Cox examines Saturn, a planet raised in the freezing outer reaches of the solar system that began life as a strange combination of rock and ice. Born outside the snow line, with an abundance of building materials, it soon grew to dwarf Earth, drawing in colossal amounts of the hydrogen and helium that permeated the early solar system. As Nasa's Cassini probe has discovered, the planet remained ring-less most of its life, until a fateful encounter changed everything. Less than a hundred million years ago, one of Saturn's ice moons was drawn too close to the planet. In a truly cataclysmic event, the entire moon was destroyed and the rings were born.</desc>

Barely visible to the naked eye, Uranus was once thought to be the furthest planet from the Sun, before Neptune was discovered. Thanks to a rare alignment of the planets in 1976, Voyager 2 was sent for mankind's only flyby of these ice worlds. Even at such cold temperatures, great storms whip around these frozen worlds, which are home to spectacular moons and intricate ring systems. Then in 2015, Nasa's New Horizons probe pushed the frontier even further into space with its extraordinary passage to the dwarf planet Pluto.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Brian Cox examines Jupiter, the largest and oldest planet in the solar system, revealing how its immense gravity influenced where other planets developed, destroying several nascent planets and negatively influencing the development of Mars. Today, Jupiter's great mass continues to be felt. Its gravity torments its moon Io, creating the most volcanically active body in the solar system. And through the vice-like grip it exerts over the asteroid belt, Jupiter's influence extends as far as Earth.</desc>

		<sub-title>Life Beyond the Sun: Saturn</sub-title>
		<desc>Professor Brian Cox examines Saturn, a planet raised in the freezing outer reaches of the solar system that began life as a strange combination of rock and ice. Born outside the snow line, with an abundance of building materials, it soon grew to dwarf Earth, drawing in colossal amounts of the hydrogen and helium that permeated the early solar system. As Nasa's Cassini probe has discovered, the planet remained ring-less most of its life, until a fateful encounter changed everything. Less than a hundred million years ago, one of Saturn's ice moons was drawn too close to the planet. In a truly cataclysmic event, the entire moon was destroyed and the rings were born.</desc>

Barely visible to the naked eye, Uranus was once thought to be the furthest planet from the Sun, before Neptune was discovered. Thanks to a rare alignment of the planets in 1976, Voyager 2 was sent for mankind's only flyby of these ice worlds. Even at such cold temperatures, great storms whip around these frozen worlds, which are home to spectacular moons and intricate ring systems. Then in 2015, Nasa's New Horizons probe pushed the frontier even further into space with its extraordinary passage to the dwarf planet Pluto.</desc>

		<desc>Michael Portillo uses his 1913 copy of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide to venture beyond Europe as he travels through the Holy Land. He begins in Israel, learning about the Baha'i faith and how it spread to Britain in the Edwardian era, hearing the story of the origins of Tel Aviv, and visiting the Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters of the capital Jerusalem. Michael then crosses the separation barrier between Jerusalem and the West Bank in the company of his Palestinian guide and meets the embroiderers of the Arab Women's Union in Bethlehem, before finishing his journey in the Negev desert.</desc>
